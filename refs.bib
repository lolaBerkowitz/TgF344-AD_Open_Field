	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and the presence of aggregates of amyloid beta (plaques) and hyperphosphorylated tau (tangles). Early diagnosis through neuropsychological testing is difficult due to comorbidity of symptoms between AD and other types of dementia. As a result, there is a need to identify the range of behavioral phenotypes expressed in AD. In the present study, we utilized a transgenic rat (TgF344-AD) model that bears the mutated amyloid precursor protein as well as presenilin-1 genes, resulting in progressive plaque and tangle pathogenesis throughout the cortex. We tested young adult male and female TgF344-AD rats in a spatial memory task in the Morris water maze and for anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze. Results indicated that regardless of sex, TgF344-AD rats exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze, which occurred without significant deficits in the spatial memory. Together, these results indicate that enhanced anxiety-like behavior represents an early-stage behavioral marker in the TgF344-AD rat model.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, has reached epidemic proportions, with major social, medical and economical burdens. With no currently available curative treatments, both the World Health Organization and the G8 Dementia Summit recently identified dementia and AD prevention as a major public health priority. Dementia and AD have a wide range of risk factors (genetic, vascular/metabolic and lifestyle-related), which often co-occur and thus interact with each other. Previous intervention efforts aimed at preventing dementia and AD focused on the management of single risk factors, with relatively modest findings. Also, the effect of risk factors depends on age at exposure, indicating that the timing of preventive interventions needs to be carefully considered. In view of the complex multifactorial nature of AD, as well as its long pre-clinical (asymptomatic) phase, interventions simultaneously targeting multiple risk factors and disease mechanisms at an early stage of the disease are most likely to be effective. Three large European multidomain prevention trials have been launched with the goal of preventing cognitive decline, dementia and AD in older adults with different risk profiles. Pharmacological trials are also shifting towards prevention of Alzheimer dementia, by targeting at-risk individuals prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms. The current review will summarize and discuss the evidence on risk and protective factors from observational studies, ongoing lifestyle-related and pharmacological randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as well as future directions for dementia and AD prevention.},

Despite significant academic research and industry efforts to elucidate the disease mechanisms operative in these disorders and to develop mechanism-based therapies, our understanding remains incomplete and our access to tractable therapeutic interventions severely limited. The magnitude of these short-comings can be measured by the growing list of disappointing clinical trials based on initially promising compounds identified in genetic animal models. This review and commentary will explore why this may be so, focusing on the central role that genetic models of neurobehavioral disorders have come to occupy in current efforts to identify disease mechanisms and therapies. In particular, we will highlight the unique pitfalls and challenges that have hampered success in these models as compared to genetic models of non-neurological diseases as well as to symptom-based models of the early 20th century that led to the discovery of all major classes of psychoactive pharmaceutical compounds still used today. Using examples from specific genetic rodent models of human neurobehavioral disorders, we will highlight issues of reproducibility, construct validity, and translational relevance in the hopes that these examples will be instructive toward greater success in future endeavors. Lastly, we will champion a two-pronged approach toward identifying novel therapies for neurobehavioral disorders that makes greater use of the historically more successful symptom-based approaches in addition to more mechanism-based approaches.},

	abstract = {Increasingly sophisticated and precise molecular genetic tools are applied to mice in order to study the cellular mechanisms underlying higher brain functions, including learning and memory. However, several studies have produced unclear or conflicting results. One reason for this is that performance in the behavioural tests used to assess learning and memory is influenced by various non-cognitive phenomena and can thus easily be affected by mutations through mechanisms unrelated to memory function. We conducted principal component analysis on data from 3003 mice tested using a standardized protocol to demonstrate this for the Morris swimming navigation test, one of the most widely used paradigms to assess memory and hippocampal function. In addition, we present a meta-analysis showing that genetic background and environment alone produce sufficient variation to span the range of most, if not all, behavioural variables and can thus easily mask or fake mutation effects if genetic studies are not designed properly. We suggest that the chance of obtaining useful results is maximized if behavioural deficits are differentiated by combining complementary behavioural protocols and by analysing multiple complementary parameters in each of them. Mutation effects must be contrasted statistically against the influences of genetic background and environment. In many situations, this is most efficiently achieved if (i) mutations are backcrossed to and maintained in one or (preferably) two well-characterized, commonly available inbred strains and (ii) if mutant and wild-type littermates are analysed on a hybrid or mixed genetic background, that is in F1 or F2 generations derived from the inbred stocks.},

Acquisition of place navigation was disrupted in a variety of tasks including: dry-land tasks in which rats searched for a hole from which to escape or searched for buried food and swimming pool tasks in which rats searched for a hidden platform on which to escape from the water. Task acquisition as well as motor performance was changed by the drug treatments in each task. Priming animals with experience on a subset of task variables did not significantly improve subsequent place performance. Priming animals with all motoric and spatial demands of a task, except the use of a specific set of distal cues aided performance, whereas priming animals with the use of a specific set distal cues but not motor experience produced little improvement in performance. The results indicate that impairments in the use of motoric skills contribute significantly to the deficits produced by cholinergic muscarinic blockade in spatial navigation tasks.},

We hypothesized that in order to solve this question particular attention has to be paid to the specific design, the analysis, and the interpretation of the learning test to be used. We thus designed a behavioral experiment along hypotheses derived from a computational model predicting that new neurons might be particularly relevant for learning conditions, in which novel aspects arise in familiar situations, thus putting high demands on the qualitative aspects of (re-)learning., In the reference memory version of the water maze task suppression of adult neurogenesis with temozolomide (TMZ) caused a highly specific learning deficit. Mice were tested in the hidden platform version of the Morris water maze (6 trials per day for 5 days with a reversal of the platform location on day 4). Testing was done at 4 weeks after the end of four cycles of treatment to minimize the number of potentially recruitable new neurons at the time of testing. The reduction of neurogenesis did not alter longterm potentiation in CA3 and the dentate gyrus but abolished the part of dentate gyrus LTP that is attributed to the new neurons. TMZ did not have any overt side effects at the time of testing, and both treated mice and controls learned to find the hidden platform. Qualitative analysis of search strategies, however, revealed that treated mice did not advance to spatially precise search strategies, in particular when learning a changed goal position (reversal). New neurons in the dentate gyrus thus seem to be necessary for adding flexibility to some hippocampus-dependent qualitative parameters of learning., Our finding that a lack of adult-generated granule cells specifically results in the animal's inability to precisely locate a hidden goal is also in accordance with a specialized role of the dentate gyrus in generating a metric rather than just a configurational map of the environment. The discovery of highly specific behavioral deficits as consequence of a suppression of adult hippocampal neurogenesis thus allows to link cellular hippocampal plasticity to well-defined hypotheses from theoretical models.},

PDAPP mice, a transgenic line overexpressing a mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) implicated in familial AD, have markedly impaired behavioral performance in the Morris water maze relative to wild-type (WT) littermates. Performance further deteriorates following experimental TBI in both PDAPP and WT mice. However, the aspects of cognitive function involved are not well understood. Here, we have analyzed search strategies used in the water maze by 3–4 month old PDAPP and WT C57Bl6 littermates both before and after moderate controlled cortical impact TBI. Prior to TBI, PDAPP mice used less spatial strategies and more nonspatial systematic strategies and strategies involving repetitive looping than WT mice. With training, PDAPP mice used more spatial strategies and less repetitive looping. After TBI, PDAPP mice lost use of spatial strategies and relied more on repetitive looping. TBI in WT mice also reduced their use of spatial strategies but instead caused a switch to nonspatial systematic strategies. We also analyzed changes in the efficiency with which mice used each individual strategy, but found that differences in which strategies were used quantitatively accounted for most of the differences in performance between groups. These results demonstrate that suboptimal search strategy use in addition to effects on spatial learning and memory underlies the impaired performance of PDAPP mice and further deterioration following TBI. Human TBI patients may have analogous poor use of problem solving strategies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the patterns of gray matter loss in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) who progress to Alzheimer disease (AD) within a fixed clinical follow-up time vs those who remain stable.
METHODS: Twenty-one subjects with aMCI were identified from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's research program who remained clinically stable for their entire observed clinical course (aMCI-S), where the minimum required follow-up time from MRI to last follow-up assessment was 3 years. These subjects were age- and gender-matched to 42 aMCI subjects who progressed to AD within 18 months of the MRI (aMCI-P). Each subject was then age- and gender-matched to a control subject. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to assess patterns of gray matter atrophy in the aMCI-P and aMCI-S groups compared to the control group, and compared to each other.
RESULTS: The aMCI-P group showed bilateral loss affecting the medial and inferior temporal lobe, temporoparietal association neocortex, and frontal lobes, compared to controls. The aMCI-S group showed no regions of gray matter loss when compared to controls. When the aMCI-P and aMCI-S groups were compared directly, the aMCI-P group showed greater loss in the medial and inferior temporal lobes, the temporoparietal neocortex, posterior cingulate, precuneus, anterior cingulate, and frontal lobes than the aMCI-S group.
CONCLUSIONS: The regions of loss observed in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) who progressed to Alzheimer disease (AD) within 18 months of the MRI are typical of subjects with AD. The lack of gray matter loss in subjects with aMCI who remained clinically stable for their entire observed clinical course is consistent with the notion that patterns of atrophy on MRI at baseline map well onto the subsequent clinical course.},

To this end we have used modern stereological techniques to compare the regional pattern of neuronal cell loss in the hippocampus related to normal ageing to that associated with Alzheimer's disease. The loss related to normal ageing was evaluated from estimates of the total number of neurons in each of the major hippocampal subdivisions of 45 normal ageing subjects who ranged in age from 13 to 101 years. The Alzheimer's disease related losses were evaluated from similar data obtained from 7 cases of Alzheimer's disease and 14 age matched controls. Qualitative differences were observed in the regional patterns of neuronal loss related to normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease. The most distinctive Alzheimer's disease related neuron loss was seen in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In the normal ageing group there was almost no neuron loss in this region (final neuron count in the CA1 region: 4.40 x 10(6) neurons for the Alzheimer's disease group vs 14.08 x 10(6) neurons in the normal ageing group). It is concluded that the neurodegenerative processes associated with normal ageing and with Alzheimer's disease are qualitatively different and that Alzheimer's disease is not accelerated by ageing but is a distinct pathological process.},

Virtual reality environments have a major advantage for the assessment of spatial navigation and memory formation, as computer-simulated first-person environments can simulate navigation in a large-scale space. Twenty-nine patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) were compared with 29 healthy matched controls on two virtual reality tasks affording to learn a virtual park (allocentric memory) and a virtual maze (egocentric memory). Participants further received a neuropsychological investigation and MRI volumetry at the time of the assessment. Results indicate that aMCI patients had significantly reduced size of the hippocampus bilaterally and the right-sided precuneus and inferior parietal cortex. aMCI patients were severely impaired learning the virtual park and the virtual maze. Smaller volumes of the right-sided precuneus were related to worse performance on the virtual maze. Participants with striatal lacunar lesions committed more errors than participants without such lesions on the virtual maze but not on the virtual park. aMCI patients later converting to dementia (n=15) had significantly smaller hippocampal size when compared with non-converters (n=14). However, both groups did not differ on virtual reality task performance. Our study clearly demonstrates the feasibility of virtual reality technology to study spatial memory deficits of persons with aMCI. Future studies should try to design spatial virtual reality tasks being specific enough to predict conversion from MCI to dementia and conversion from normal to MCI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: New research criteria for preclinical Alzheimer's disease have been proposed, which include stages for cognitively normal individuals with abnormal amyloid markers (stage 1), abnormal amyloid and neuronal injury markers (stage 2), or abnormal amyloid and neuronal injury markers and subtle cognitive changes (stage 3). We aimed to investigate the prevalence and long-term outcome of preclinical Alzheimer's disease according to these criteria.
METHODS: Participants were cognitively normal (clinical dementia rating [CDR]=0) community-dwelling volunteers aged at least 65 years who were enrolled between 1998 and 2011 at the Washington University School of Medicine (MO, USA). CSF amyloid-β1-42 and tau concentrations and a memory composite score were used to classify participants as normal (both markers normal), preclinical Alzheimer's disease stage 1-3, or suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology (SNAP, abnormal injury marker without abnormal amyloid marker). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants in each preclinical AD stage. Secondary outcomes included progression to CDR at least 0·5, symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (score of at least 0·5 for memory and at least one other domain and cognitive impairments deemed to be due to Alzheimer's disease), and mortality. We undertook survival analyses using subdistribution and standard Cox hazards models and linear mixed models.
FINDINGS: Of 311 participants, 129 (41\%) were classed as normal, 47 (15\%) as stage 1, 36 (12\%) as stage 2, 13 (4\%) as stage 3, 72 (23\%) as SNAP, and 14 (5\%) remained unclassified. The 5-year progression rate to CDR at least 0·5, symptomatic Alzheimer's disease was 2\% for participants classed as normal, 11\% for stage 1, 26\% for stage 2, 56\% for stage 3, and 5\% for SNAP. Compared with individuals classed as normal, participants with preclinical Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death after adjusting for covariates (hazard ratio 6·2, 95\% CI 1·1-35·0; p=0·040).
INTERPRETATION: Preclinical Alzheimer's disease is common in cognitively normal elderly people and is associated with future cognitive decline and mortality. Thus, preclinical Alzheimer's disease could be an important target for therapeutic intervention.

	abstract = {Maneuvering safely through the environment is central to survival of almost all species. The ability to do this depends on learning and remembering locations. This capacity is encoded in the brain by two systems: one using cues outside the organism (distal cues), allocentric navigation, and one using self-movement, internal cues and nearby proximal cues, egocentric navigation. Allocentric navigation involves the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and surrounding structures; in humans this system encodes allocentric, semantic, and episodic memory. This form of memory is assessed in laboratory animals in many ways, but the dominant form of assessment is the Morris water maze (MWM). Egocentric navigation involves the dorsal striatum and connected structures; in humans this system encodes routes and integrated paths and, when overlearned, becomes procedural memory. In this article, several allocentric assessment methods for rodents are reviewed and compared with the MWM. MWM advantages (little training required, no food deprivation, ease of testing, rapid and reliable learning, insensitivity to differences in body weight and appetite, absence of nonperformers, control methods for proximal cue learning, and performance effects) and disadvantages (concern about stress, perhaps not as sensitive for working memory) are discussed. Evidence-based design improvements and testing methods are reviewed for both rats and mice. Experimental factors that apply generally to spatial navigation and to MWM specifically are considered. It is concluded that, on balance, the MWM has more advantages than disadvantages and compares favorably with other allocentric navigation tasks.},

Reversal and shift trials enhance the detection of spatial impairments. Trial-dependent, latent and discrimination learning can be assessed using modifications of the basic protocol. Search-to-platform area determines the degree of reliance on spatial versus non-spatial strategies. Cued trials determine whether performance factors that are unrelated to place learning are present. Escape from water is relatively immune from activity or body mass differences, making it ideal for many experimental models. The MWM has proven to be a robust and reliable test that is strongly correlated with hippocampal synaptic plasticity and NMDA receptor function.

In both strains, results showed a beneficial effect of prior experience on this spatial memory task even 8 months after the initial training. At 18 months of age, performance of C57 mice that were trained at 2 months of age for the first time was similar to those who received their first training at 10 months of age. These findings suggest that the beneficial effect of previous training could be limited by time. In addition, water maze performance of 18 month-old C57 mice did not differ from their earlier performance when they were 10 months of age, which would indicate that experience in this task could prevent some of the age-related spatial learning deficits observed in mice.},

METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study in 442 nondemented adults (mean age 79.9 years). Spatial navigation measured with the Floor Maze Test and reported as immediate maze time (IMT) and delayed maze time (DMT). Predementia syndromes, mild cognitive impairment syndrome (MCI) and motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), were primary outcomes.
RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 16.5 ± 13.7 months, 41 participants developed MCI and 30 participants developed MCR. In Cox models adjusted for age, sex, education, cognitive status, comorbid illnesses, and maze errors, a 10-second increment on IMT predicted incident MCI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.25; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.48) and MCR (aHR: 1.53; 95\% CI: 1.23-1.90). DMT predicted MCR but not MCI.
DISCUSSION: Spatial navigation performance predicted predementia syndromes in aging and implicates navigational impairments as an early feature in dementias.},

	abstract = {Many studies have used repeated testing at different ages to study the age-related decline in learning and memory in animals. Generally, it has been assumed that performance is relatively independent of prior exposure(s). The present study tested the hypothesis that rats retain a significant memory of some aspects of spatial tasks for many months. Sprague-Dawley rats were trained in a repeated acquisition water maze task at 12 months of age, and retested in the same task at 24 months of age. Compared to 24-month-old naive rats, the pretrained rats initially performed significantly better on their first days of retesting at 24 months of age. In a second experiment, animals were trained for 2 weeks at 12 months of age and tested/retested for 2 weeks at the age of 24 months. Whereas the performance of the 24-month-old naive group improved over the 2 weeks of testing, the latencies of the pretrained animals were consistently shorter both initially, and throughout the testing. The performance of the pretrained rats in the second week of testing was similar to young rats. Together these data indicate that 24-month-old rats can learn spatial tasks well and that the performance of old rats in spatial tasks can be significantly influenced by prior exposure to that task, even 12 months earlier.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have identified neurons in the postsubiculum which discharge as a function of the animal's head direction in the horizontal plane, independent of its behavior and location in the environment. Anatomical studies have shown that the postsubiculum contains reciprocal connections with the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN). In order to determine how the head direction (HD) cell signal is processed in the brain, single-unit recordings were monitored in the ATN of freely moving rats in order to characterize their behavioral and spatial correlates. Animals were trained to retrieve food pellets thrown randomly into a cylindrical apparatus containing a single orientation cue. Single unit recordings in the ATN showed that approximately 60\% of the recorded cells discharged in relation to the animal's head direction in the horizontal plane. Observation of the animal and quantitative analyses showed that HD cell firing was not dependent on the animal's behavior, trunk position, linear speed, angular head velocity, or location in the environment. Most of these cells were localized to the anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus. Each HD cell contained only one head direction at which the cell discharged maximally and the firing rate decreased linearly away from this preferred direction. The preferred firing directions from all cells recorded were distributed over a 360 degrees range. Quantitative analysis showed that these cells contained similar discharge parameters (peak firing rate, directional firing range) to values reported previously for postsubicular HD cells (Taube et al., 1990a). Experiments involving rotation of the orientation cue showed that the preferred firing direction could be controlled by a salient visual cue. In contrast to postsubicular HD cells, passive rotation of a restrained animal showed that most ATN HD cells ceased discharging when the animal's head was oriented in the preferred direction. These findings demonstrate the presence of HD cells in the ATN and indicate the potential importance of this area for spatial navigation. The origin of the head direction signal is discussed and it is concluded that because of the presence of reciprocal connections between the postsubiculum and the ATN, further studies are required in order to determine the direction in which this head-directional information is flowing. Finally, ATN HD cells differ from postsubicular HD cells by appearing to require volitional motoric input.},

Third, our analysis suggested that a prevalence of allocentric impairment exists.

The initial formation of tangles and plaques in healthy aging appeared to be independent of each other. Tangles were found in all the nondemented cases, especially in hippocampal and parahippocampal areas; the average tangle concentration increased exponentially with age. In contrast, plaques were absent in some brains up to age 88, and the earliest plaque formation in other cases occurred in the neocortex, in patches of diffuse plaques. Widely distributed neuritic as well as diffuse plaques throughout neocortex and limbic structures characterized a further group of nondemented cases. In these cases there was also a substantial increase over other nondemented cases, both in the number of tangles and in the rate of increase in tangles with age, suggesting an interaction between amyloid and neurofibrillary change at this stage.

	abstract = {Men and women exhibit differences in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The factors underlying the sex differences in AD are not well understood. This Review emphasizes the contributions of sex steroid hormones to the relationship between sex and AD. In women, events that decrease lifetime exposure to estrogens are generally associated with increased AD risk, whereas estrogen-based hormone therapy administered near the time of menopause may reduce AD risk. In men, estrogens do not exhibit age-related reduction and are not significantly associated with AD risk. Rather, normal age-related depletions of testosterone in plasma and brain predict enhanced vulnerability to AD. Both estrogens and androgens exert numerous protective actions in the adult brain that increase neural functioning and resilience as well as specifically attenuating multiple aspects of AD-related neuropathology. Aging diminishes the activational effects of sex hormones in sex-specific manners, which is hypothesized to contribute to the relationship between aging and AD. Sex steroid hormones may also drive sex differences in AD through their organizational effects during developmental sexual differentiation of the brain. Specifically, sex hormone actions during early development may confer inherent vulnerability of the female brain to development of AD in advanced age. The combined effects of organizational and activational effects of sex steroids yield distinct sex differences in AD pathogenesis, a significant variable that must be more rigorously considered in future research. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The concept of cognitive impairment intervening between normal ageing and very early dementia has been in the literature for many years. Recently, the construct of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been proposed to designate an early, but abnormal, state of cognitive impairment. MCI has generated a great deal of research from both clinical and research perspectives. Numerous epidemiological studies have documented the accelerated rate of progression to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in MCI subjects and certain predictor variables appear valid. However, there has been controversy regarding the precise definition of the concept and its implementation in various clinical settings. Clinical subtypes of MCI have been proposed to broaden the concept and include prodromal forms of a variety of dementias. It is suggested that the diagnosis of MCI can be made in a fashion similar to the clinical diagnoses of dementia and AD. An algorithm is presented to assist the clinician in identifying subjects and subclassifying them into the various types of MCI. By refining the criteria for MCI, clinical trials can be designed with appropriate inclusion and exclusion restrictions to allow for the investigation of therapeutics tailored for specific targets and populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Based on the hypothesis that declarative memory and navigation ability depend on hippocampal integrity, and the fact that declarative memory declines early in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the authors suggest that topographical disorientation (TD) will be an early manifestation of AD.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with AD based on DSM-IV criteria, residing at home, were studied in a clinic at a 1000-bed referral medical center. Patient characteristics, disease condition, performance on neuropsychological tests, and navigation function were compared between patients with and without current TD. Information regarding the extent and duration of TD and the level of current navigational function were collected during a clinical interview.
RESULTS: 112 patients (61 males and 51 females) with mean age of 74 years and disease duration of 37 months completed the study. Among them, 61 currently experienced TD, 20 had required an escort to their home by others, and 28 had TD as an incipient symptom. Those with current TD tended to have a longer disease duration, required an escort to their home by others, and reported a history of repeated change of residence, TD as an incipient symptom, a restricted spatial range within which they felt comfortable (safety range), and disorientation when they were out of familiar territory. In addition, care-givers reported a high level of concern for the safety of those with TD when he or she traveled alone.
CONCLUSION: TD in community-dwelling AD patient is common. Caregivers should pay attention to those with longer disease duration and try to avoid changing residence. Developing a brief and valid test for topographical orientation will be helpful for the early detection of TD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated a simple imaging sign for Alzheimer's disease (AD), using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We hypothesized that a reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the fornix could be utilized as an imaging sign.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients with AD, 24 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 25 control participants (NC) underwent DTI at baseline and 1 year later. The diagnosis was reevaluated 1 year and 3 years after the initial scan. A color-scaled FA map was used to visually identify the FA reduction ("fornix sign"). We investigated whether the fornix sign could separate AD from NC, and could predict progression from aMCI to AD or NC to aMCI. We also quantified FA of the fornix to validate the fornix sign.
RESULTS: The fornix sign was identical to the lack of any voxels with an FA {\textgreater} .52 within the fornix. The fornix sign differentiated AD from NC with specificity of 1.0 and sensitivity of .56. It predicted conversion from NC to aMCI with specificity of 1.0 and sensitivity of .67, and from aMCI to AD with specificity of .94 and sensitivity of .83.
CONCLUSION: The fornix sign is a promising predictive imaging sign of AD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify regional brain metabolic dysfunctions associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD).
METHODS: We stratified 115 cognitively normal individuals into preclinical AD (both amyloid and tau pathologies present), asymptomatic at risk for AD (either amyloid or tau pathology present), or healthy controls (no amyloid or tau pathology present) using [(18)F]florbetapir PET and CSF phosphorylated tau biomarkers. Regression and voxel-based regression models evaluated the relationships between baseline NPS measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and baseline and 2-year change in metabolism measured by [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET.
RESULTS: Individuals with preclinical AD with higher NPI scores had higher [(18)F]FDG uptake in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and right anterior insula at baseline. High NPI scores predicted subsequent hypometabolism in the PCC over 2 years only in individuals with preclinical AD. Sleep/nighttime behavior disorders and irritability and lability were the components of the NPI that drove this metabolic dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of NPS in preclinical cases, driven by sleep behavior and irritability domains, is linked to transitory metabolic dysfunctions within limbic networks vulnerable to the AD process and predicts subsequent PCC hypometabolism. These findings support an emerging conceptual framework in which NPS constitute an early clinical manifestation of AD pathophysiology.},

Hippocampal volume was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and CSF markers of Aβ42, tau and p-tau181 were also measured. Worse performance on a wide range of memory and sustained attention tasks were associated with reduced hippocampal volume, higher CSF tau and p-tau181 and increased tau/Aβ42 ratio. Memory tasks were also associated with lower ability to conduct functional activities of daily living, providing a link between AD biomarkers, memory performance and functional outcome.

More than 5 million people in the US alone are affected with AD and this number is expected to triple by 2050. While men may have a higher risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia, women are disproportionally affected with AD. One explanation is that men may die of competing causes of death earlier in life, so that only the most resilient men may survive to older ages. However, many other factors should also be considered to explain the sex differences. In this review, we discuss the differences observed in men versus women in the incidence and prevalence of MCI and AD, in the structure and function of the brain, and in the sex-specific and gender-specific risk and protective factors for AD. In medical research, sex refers to biological differences such as chromosomal differences (eg, XX versus XY chromosomes), gonadal differences, or hormonal differences. In contrast, gender refers to psychosocial and cultural differences between men and women (eg, access to education and occupation). Both factors play an important role in the development and progression of diseases, including AD. Understanding both sex- and gender-specific risk and protective factors for AD is critical for developing individualized interventions for the prevention and treatment of AD.},

In addition, the huge amount of preclinical evidence arising from these animal models was necessary for the further clinical development of pharmacological agents capable of interfering with most of the impaired neural pathways in AD patients. In this respect, a significant role is played by the dysfunction of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission responsible for the cognitive and behavioral symptoms described in AD patients. The aim of this review is to summarize the main animal models that contributed toward unraveling the pathological changes in neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and receptor binding in AD preclinical studies. The review also provides an updated description of the current pharmacological agents - still under clinical development - acting on the neurotransmitter systems.},

	abstract = {Sex differences are a well-known phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with women having a higher risk for AD than men. Many AD mouse models display a similar sex-dependent pattern, with females showing earlier cognitive deficits and more severe neuropathology than males. However, whether those differences are relevant to human disease is unclear. Here we show that in AD mouse models that overexpress amyloid precursor protein (APP) under control of the prion protein promoter (PrP), female transgenic mice have higher APP expression than males, complicating interpretations of the role of sex-related factors in such models. By contrast, in a tTa:APPsi model, in which APP expression is driven by the tetracycline transactivator (tTa) from the CaMKIIα promoter, there are no sex-related differences in expression or processing of APP. In addition, the levels of Aβ dimers and tetramers, as well as Aβ peptide accumulation, are similar between sexes. Behavioral testing demonstrated that both male and female tTa:APPsi mice develop age-dependent deficits in spatial recognition memory and conditional freezing to context. These cognitive deficits were accompanied by habituation-associated hyperlocomotion and startle hyper-reactivity. Significant sex-related dimorphisms were observed, due to females showing earlier onsets of the deficits in conditioned freezing and hyperlocomotion. In addition, tTa:APPsi males but not females demonstrated a lack of novelty-induced activation. Both males and females showed atrophy of the dentate gyrus (DG) of the dorsal hippocampus, associated with widening of the pyramidal layer of the CA1 area in both sexes. Ventral DG was preserved. Sex-related differences were limited to the DG, with females showing more advanced degeneration than males. Collectively, our data show that the tTa:APPsi model is characterized by a lack of sex-related differences in APP expression, making this model useful in deciphering the mechanisms of sex differences in AD pathogenesis. Sex-related dimorphisms observed in this model under conditions of equal APP expression between sexes suggest a higher sensitivity of females to the effects of APP and/or Aβ production.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible and highly progressive neurodegenerative disease. Clinically, patients with AD display impairments in episodic and spatial memory. However, the underlying neuronal dysfunctions that result in these impairments remain poorly understood. The hippocampus is crucial for spatial and episodic memory, and thus we tested the hypothesis that abnormal neuronal representations of space in the hippocampus contribute to memory deficits in AD. To test this hypothesis, we recorded spikes from place cells in hippocampal subfield CA1, together with corresponding rhythmic activity in local field potentials, in the 3xTg AD mouse model. We observed disturbances in place cell firing patterns, many of which were consistent with place cell disturbances reported in other rodent models of AD. We found place cell representations of space to be unstable in 3xTg mice compared to control mice. Furthermore, coordination of place cell firing by hippocampal rhythms was disrupted in 3xTg mice. Specifically, a smaller proportion of place cells from 3xTg mice were significantly phase-locked to theta and slow gamma rhythms, and the theta and slow gamma phases at which spikes occurred were also altered. Remarkably, these disturbances were observed at an age before detectable Aβ pathology had developed. Consistencies between these findings in 3xTg mice and previous findings from other AD models suggest that disturbances in place cell firing and hippocampal rhythms are related to AD rather than reflecting peculiarities inherent to a particular transgenic model. Thus, disturbed rhythmic organization of place cell activity may contribute to unstable spatial representations, and related spatial memory deficits, in AD. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Multiple linear regression analysis showed significant correlations between HFC and the episodic memory performance. Conjunction analysis between neural correlates of memory and altered HFC showed the overlapping regions, especially the subcortical regions such as thalamus, caudate nucleus, and cingulate cortices involved in the Papez circuit.

Depending on the subtest, the subjects could use the egocentric or allocentric (hippocampus-dependent) navigation.
RESULTS: The AD and aMCI multiple domain groups were impaired in all subtests. The aMCI single domain group was impaired in allocentric subtests. The hippocampal MCI group performed poorer than the nonhippocampal MCI group and similarly to the AD group. The ApoE4+ group was as bad as the AD group when compared with the E4- group.
CONCLUSION: aMCI subjects represent a very heterogeneous population, and spatial memory or cued recall examination can add more value to aMCI classification. ApoE4+ patients are more impaired than ApoE4- patients.},

We found that young adults at genetic risk for AD (APOE-ε4 carriers) exhibit reduced grid-cell-like representations and altered navigational behavior in a virtual arena. Both changes were associated with impaired spatial memory performance. Reduced grid-cell-like representations were also related to increased hippocampal activity, potentially reflecting compensatory mechanisms that prevent overt spatial memory impairment in APOE-ε4 carriers.

	abstract = {To determine if early cognitive sensorimotor deficits exist in APP(SW) transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP). Tg+ and Tg- animals at both 3 and 9 months of age (3M and 9M, respectively) were evaluated in a comprehensive battery of measures. The performance of all Tg+ mice at both ages was no different from all Tg- controls in Y-maze alternations, water maze acquisition, passive avoidance, and active avoidance testing. By contrast, results from other tasks revealed substantive cognitive deficits in Tg+ mice that were usually gender-dependent and sometimes progressive in nature. Between 3M and 9M, a progressive impairment was observed in circular platform performance by Tg+ males, as was a progressive deficit in visible platform testing for all Tg+ animals. Other transgenic effects included both impaired water maze retention and circular platform performance in 3M Tg+ females; this later effect was responsible for an overall (males + females) Tg+ deficit in circular platform performance at 3M. Sensorimotor testing revealed several Tg+ effects, most notably an increased activity of Tg+ males in both open field and Y-maze at 3M. Significant correlations between a number of behavioral measures were observed, although factor analysis suggests that each task measured components of sensorimotor/cognitive function not measured by other tasks. Finally, Tg+ mice had lower survivability than Tg- animals through 9M (85 vs. 96\%). In summary, these results demonstrate the presence of gender-related and progressive cognitive deficits in APP(SW) transgenic mice at a relatively early age (i.e., prior to overt, beta-amyloid deposition in the brain), suggesting a pathophysiologic role for elevated levels of 'soluble' beta-amyloid in such impairments.},

Hitherto studies on AD-associated neurovascular injury have used animal models that exhibit only a subset of AD-like pathologies and demonstrated some Aβ-dependent vascular dysfunction and destabilization of neuronal network. The present work focuses on the early stage of disease progression and uses TgF344-AD rats that recapitulate a broader repertoire of AD-like pathologies to investigate the cerebrovascular and neuronal network functioning using in situ two-photon fluorescence microscopy and laminar array recordings of local field potentials, followed by pathological analyses of vascular wall morphology, tau hyperphosphorylation, and amyloid plaques. Concomitant to widespread amyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, cerebrovascular reactivity was strongly attenuated in cortical penetrating arterioles and venules of TgF344-AD rats in comparison to those in non-transgenic littermates. Blood flow elevation to hypercapnia was abolished in TgF344-AD rats. Concomitantly, the phase-amplitude coupling of the neuronal network was impaired, evidenced by decreased modulation of theta band phase on gamma band amplitude. These results demonstrate significant neurovascular network dysfunction at an early stage of AD-like pathology. Our study identifies early markers of pathology progression and call for development of combinatorial treatment plans.},

Supporting evidence for this contention is that damage to either of two brain regions, the medial temporal lobe and the medial diencephalon, is most consistently associated with anterograde amnesia. Within these respective regions, the hippocampal formation and the ATN (anteromedial, anteroventral, and anterodorsal) are the particular structures of interest. The extensive direct and indirect hippocampal-anterior thalamic interconnections and the presence of theta-modulated cells in both sites further support the hypothesis that these structures constitute a neuronal network crucial for memory and cognition. The major tool in understanding how the brain processes information is the analysis of neuronal output at each hierarchical level along the pathway of signal propagation coupled with neuroanatomical studies. Here, we discuss the electrophysiological properties of cells in the ATN with an emphasis on their role in spatial navigation.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to use serial imaging to gain insight into the sequence of pathologic events in Alzheimer's disease, and the clinical features associated with this sequence. We measured change in amyloid deposition over time using serial (11)C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography and progression of neurodegeneration using serial structural magnetic resonance imaging. We studied 21 healthy cognitively normal subjects, 32 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 8 with Alzheimer's disease. Subjects were drawn from two sources--ongoing longitudinal registries at Mayo Clinic, and the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). All subjects underwent clinical assessments, MRI and PIB studies at two time points, approximately one year apart. PIB retention was quantified in global cortical to cerebellar ratio units and brain atrophy in units of cm(3) by measuring ventricular expansion. The annual change in global PIB retention did not differ by clinical group (P = 0.90), and although small (median 0.042 ratio units/year overall) was greater than zero among all subjects (P {\textless} 0.001). Ventricular expansion rates differed by clinical group (P {\textless} 0.001) and increased in the following order: cognitively normal (1.3 cm(3)/year) {\textless} amnestic mild cognitive impairment (2.5 cm(3)/year) {\textless} Alzheimer's disease (7.7 cm(3)/year). Among all subjects there was no correlation between PIB change and concurrent change on CDR-SB (r = -0.01, P = 0.97) but some evidence of a weak correlation with MMSE (r =-0.22, P = 0.09). In contrast, greater rates of ventricular expansion were clearly correlated with worsening concurrent change on CDR-SB (r = 0.42, P {\textless} 0.01) and MMSE (r =-0.52, P {\textless} 0.01). Our data are consistent with a model of typical late onset Alzheimer's disease that has two main features: (i) dissociation between the rate of amyloid deposition and the rate of neurodegeneration late in life, with amyloid deposition proceeding at a constant slow rate while neurodegeneration accelerates and (ii) clinical symptoms are coupled to neurodegeneration not amyloid deposition. Significant plaque deposition occurs prior to clinical decline. The presence of brain amyloidosis alone is not sufficient to produce cognitive decline, rather, the neurodegenerative component of Alzheimer's disease pathology is the direct substrate of cognitive impairment and the rate of cognitive decline is driven by the rate of neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration (atrophy on MRI) both precedes and parallels cognitive decline. This model implies a complimentary role for MRI and PIB imaging in Alzheimer's disease, with each reflecting one of the major pathologies, amyloid dysmetabolism and neurodegeneration.},

Through a multifactorial data-driven analysis, we obtain dynamic LOAD-abnormality indices for all biomarkers, and a tentative temporal ordering of disease progression. Imaging results suggest that intra-brain vascular dysregulation is an early pathological event during disease development. Cognitive decline is noticeable from initial LOAD stages, suggesting early memory deficit associated with the primary disease factors. High abnormality levels are also observed for specific proteins associated with the vascular system's integrity.

	abstract = {Open mazes are primarily designed to measure place learning and memory, using environmental visuospatial cues. However, maze tasks differ along many dimensions, including (1) types of apparatus, which vary from arenas (water maze: WM) to highly structured routes (radial-arm maze: RAM); (2) availability of visuospatial, associative or sensory cues; (3) task requirements which range from spontaneous exploration to complex sequences of choices; and (4) motivation which may involve aversive escape, the opportunity to shelter or to discover novel objects or food at particular locations. Given this diversity, it is likely that mazes tap a variety of processes that contribute to, or affect spatial learning. Hence 'spatial' abilities measured in one procedure may not resemble those engaged in another, posing problems for the interpretation of drug- or lesion-induced deficits. This review compares two types of maze that exemplify key differences in procedure: the RAM and the WM. (1) Visuospatial, associative and sensory factors contributing to place learning in the two mazes are discussed, together with the types of search strategy that they foster, their differing motivation and vulnerability to effects of non-spatial factors, such as stress and training regime. (2) The equivalence of memory processes (acquisition, working and reference memory) assessed in different mazes is considered, and the extent that these may generalize to non-spatial tasks. (3) Differences in application of the two mazes are evaluated. The WM is well-adapted to the study of selective visuospatial factors in place learning and working memory, but less suitable for repeated measures or for assessment of long-term memory deficits. The RAM detects steady-state reference and working-memory deficits, and is suitable for repeated measures, at the expense of precise analysis of the nature of the processes involved.},

This conclusion has been questioned in recent work, suggesting that it is damage to the underlying cingulum bundle (CG) (areas CG and IG), and not RS, that disrupts spatial place learning (Aggleton et al., 2000). We revisited this issue by comparing Long-Evans rats, the strain used in studies that report RS deficits, to Dark Agouti rats, the strain in which no RS deficit has been reported. Rat groups with RS, RS + CG, or no lesion were tested on a place task in a swimming pool, a test of nonspatial and spatial learning, and a matching-to-place task, a relatively selective test of spatial learning. Long-Evans rats given RS and RS + CG lesions, either before or after training on the two tasks, were impaired on both tasks, a deficit not attributable to impaired visual acuity. Control Dark Agouti rats and RS Dark Agouti rats, although not different on the place task, were both significantly impaired relative to Long-Evans rats. The RS Dark Agouti group, however, was also impaired on the matching-to-place task. Thus, we show that RS cortex is part of an extended neural circuit involved in spatial behavior in both Long-Evans and Dark Agouti rats, but its role in the place task may be masked by an innate nonspatial deficit in Dark Agouti rats. The results are discussed in relation to the importance of assessing spatial learning with appropriate spatial tests, the problems of interpretation posed by rat strain differences, and the role of retrosplenial cortex in spatial behavior.},

MEC neurons fire in a precise, geometric pattern, forming a hexagonal grid that tessellates the surface of environments. Similar to place cells and head direction cells, the orientation of grid cell firing patterns can be controlled by visual landmarks, but the cells maintain their firing patterns even in the dark. Place cells and head direction cells can also completely decouple from external landmarks in the light, but it is not known whether the MEC and parahippocampal regions exhibit similar properties or are more explicitly tied to external landmarks. We recorded neurons in the MEC, parasubiculum, and CA1 and head direction cells of the anterior thalamus as the rat's internal direction sense was pitted against a salient visual landmark by slowly rotating the rat in a covered bucket while counter-rotating the visual cue. In different sessions, spatial firing rate maps and head direction tuning curves either rotated their preferred firing locations/directions by the same amount as the bucket rotation or maintained their preferences in the external laboratory framework. In few cases, the firing preferences rotated with the cue card. When cells from different regions were recorded simultaneously, the dominant response in one area almost always matched the response of the other areas. Although dominant responses were consistent throughout the recording regions, CA1 ensembles exhibited a greater degree of response heterogeneity than other regions, which nearly all exhibited internally consistent responses. Thus, the parahippocampal and MEC input to the hippocampus can be controlled by the animal's internal direction sense (presumably reflected in the firing of head direction cells) and become completely decoupled from external sensory input, yet maintain internal coherence with each other and in general with the place cell system of the hippocampus.},

In addition, MEC rats were as impaired in the water maze as hippocampus rats, while rats with combined MEC and hippocampal lesions had an even greater deficit. However, MEC rats were not impaired on other hippocampus-dependent tasks, including those in which an object location or context was remembered.

OBJECTIVE: To verify the occurrence of TD and to identify the neuropsychological dysfunctions associated with TD in AD.
METHOD: Thirty patients with probable AD, their caregivers and 30 subjects without dementia (controls) were interviewed with a questionnaire and evaluated with tests related to topographical orientation.
RESULTS: AD patients, even those with mild dementia, differ from controls in the questionnaire on topographical orientation and in most neuropsychological tests except for tests of spatial working memory, point localization, three dimension and nonsense figure copy. When the performances in the neuropsychological tests of patients with mild or moderate dementia were compared, only landmark recognition and route description were more impaired in moderate dementia.
CONCLUSION: TD occurs even in mild dementia of AD, a finding apparently not explained by the impairments of more elementary spatial functions.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary cause of age-related dementia. Effective strategies to prevent and treat AD remain elusive despite major efforts to understand its basic biology and clinical pathophysiology. Significant investments in therapeutic drug discovery programs over the past two decades have yielded some important insights but no blockbuster drugs to alter the course of disease. Because significant memory loss and cognitive decline are associated with neuron death and loss of gray matter, especially in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, some focus in drug development has shifted to early prevention of cellular pathology. Although clinical trial design is challenging, due in part to a lack of robust biomarkers with predictive value, some optimism has come from the identification and study of inherited forms of early-onset AD and genetic risk factors that provide insights about molecular pathophysiology and potential drug targets. In addition, better understanding of the Aβ amyloid pathway and the tau pathway-leading to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively, which are histopathological hallmarks of AD-continues to drive significant drug research and development programs. The main focus of this review is to summarize the most recent basic biology, biochemistry, and pharmacology that serve as a foundation for more than 50 active advanced-phase clinical trials for AD prevention and therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevalence studies on dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) have reported a positive association with age. However, the trend of the association in the oldest-old categories has been the subject of discussion. The relationship between sex and AD has been inconsistent with these studies. Prevalence rates are influenced by the survival and disease incidence. Incidence rates provide a better measure of disease risk.
METHODS: English-language articles identified through a MEDLINE search on "incidence dementia" and "incidence Alzheimer's disease" were examined and references from identified articles were reviewed. Population-based studies using personal interviews, standard clinical diagnosis criteria (DSM-III for dementia, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorder Association for AD) and reporting age-specific incidence rates were included in the meta-analysis. Data from the selected studies were extracted and verified. Mixed-effect models were used in the meta-analysis to accommodate the heterogeneity of the studies.
RESULTS: Incident dementia and AD are associated with a significant quadratic age effect indicating that the increase in incidence rates slows down with the increase in age, although there is no sign of a decline in the incidence rates themselves. The odds ratios for women to develop incidence of dementia and AD relative to men are 1.18 (95\% confidence interval, 0.95-1.46) and 1.56 (95\% confidence interval, 1.16-2.10), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The acceleration of incidence rates for AD and dementia slows down with the increase in age, although we find no evidence of a rate decline. Women are at higher risk of developing AD than men.},

Also described is the development of a learning index that provides a continuous, graded measure of the severity of age-related impairment in the task.

Plasticity mechanisms allow the hippocampus to store learned sequences of locations that may allow predictions of future locations based on past experience. These sequences can also be activated during navigational behavior in ways that may allow the animal to learn trajectories toward goals. Task-dependent alterations in place cell firing patterns may reflect the operation of the hippocampus in associating locations with navigationally relevant decision variables.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) refers to a diagnosis at the stage when patients come to the attention of clinicians because of concerns about changes in cognition, behavior, or functioning and can be still free of dementia and functionally independent.
OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively review existing scientific evidence on the benefits and potential challenges of making a timely diagnosis of AD.
METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching electronic databases (Medline, Embase) and bibliographies for studies published in English between 1 January 2000 and 2 June 2014 on the consequences of a timely diagnosis of AD.
RESULTS: Nine studies were identified that investigated the consequences of diagnosing AD at the initial stages; none were specifically focused on prodromal AD. A timely diagnosis potentially offers the opportunities of early intervention, implementation of coordinated care plans, better management of symptoms, patient safety, cost savings, and postponement of institutionalization. Barriers to making a timely diagnosis include stigma, suicide risk, lack of training, diagnostic uncertainty, shortage of specialized diagnostic services, and the reluctance of healthcare providers to make a diagnosis when no effective disease-modifying options are available.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its potential benefits, few published studies have explored the advantages or risks of a timely diagnosis of AD. In light of the cultural shift toward diagnosis at the initial stage of the disease continuum, when the patient does not yet have dementia, more investigations are needed to evaluate the benefits and address the barriers that may impede making a timely AD diagnosis.},

Distinctive and reliable biomarkers of AD are now available through structural MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. This progress provides the impetus for our proposal of revised diagnostic criteria for AD. Our framework was developed to capture both the earliest stages, before full-blown dementia, as well as the full spectrum of the illness. These new criteria are centred on a clinical core of early and significant episodic memory impairment. They stipulate that there must also be at least one or more abnormal biomarkers among structural neuroimaging with MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of amyloid beta or tau proteins. The timeliness of these criteria is highlighted by the many drugs in development that are directed at changing pathogenesis, particularly at the production and clearance of amyloid beta as well as at the hyperphosphorylation state of tau. Validation studies in existing and prospective cohorts are needed to advance these criteria and optimise their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying navigation impairments in Alzheimer disease (AD) are unknown. We characterized navigation in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to test the hypothesis that navigation disability reflects selective impairments in spatial cognition and relates to atrophy of specific brain regions.
METHODS: We compared 13 mild AD and 21 MCI patients with 24 controls on a route-learning task that engaged various spatial processes. Using structural MRI and optimized voxel-based morphometry, we also investigated the neural correlates of spatial abilities in a subset of subjects (10 AD, 12 MCI, 21 controls).
RESULTS: AD and MCI patients recognized landmarks as effectively as controls, but could not find their locations on maps or recall the order in which they were encountered. Half of AD and one-quarter of MCI patients got lost on the route, compared with less than 10\% of controls. Regardless of diagnosis, patients who got lost had lower right posterior hippocampal and parietal volumes than patients and controls who did not get lost. The ability to identify locations on a map correlated with right posterior hippocampal and parietal volumes, whereas order memory scores correlated with bilateral inferior frontal volumes.
CONCLUSIONS: The navigation disability in Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) involves a selective impairment of spatial cognition and is associated with atrophy of the right-lateralized navigation network. Extensive spatial impairments in MCI suggest that navigation tests may provide early markers of cognitive and neural damage.},

We find that male and female 3xTg-AD mice show comparable impairments on Morris water maze (MWM) and inhibitory avoidance (IA) at 4 months. Shortly thereafter, however, the cognitive performance varies among the sexes, with females performing worse than males. These behavioral differences are not attributable to differences in Abeta or tau levels. The behavioral effect is transient as from 12 months onward, the disparity is no longer apparent. Because females perform worse than males on stressful tasks, we explored their corticosterone responses and find that young female 3xTg-AD mice show markedly heightened corticosterone response after 5 days of MWM training compared to age-matched male 3xTg-AD mice; this difference is no longer apparent in older mice. Thus, the enhanced corticosterone response of the young female mice likely underlies their poorer performance on stressful tasks.},

Her verbal memory and her recognition memory for unknown buildings, landmarks and outdoor scenes was intact, although she showed an impairment in face processing. By contrast, her navigational ability, quantitatively assessed within a small virtual reality (VR) town, was significantly impaired. Interestingly, she showed a selective impairment in a VR object-location memory test whenever her viewpoint was shifted between presentation and test, but not when tested from the same viewpoint. We suggest that a specific impairment in locating objects relative to the environment rather than relative to the perceived viewpoint (i.e. allocentric rather than egocentric spatial memory) underlies her topographical disorientation. We discuss the likely neural bases of this deficit in the light of related studies in humans and animals, focusing on the hippocampus and related areas.

Initial changes occur in comparatively young individuals and can also be observed at the same predilection sites in a few species of old aged domestic animals. In a later state of destruction, AT8 immunoreactive neurons develop typical argyrophilic neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. Six stages of disease propagation can be distinguished with respect to the location of the tangle-bearing neurons and the severity of changes (transentorhinal stages I–II: clinically silent cases; limbic stages III–IV: incipient Alzheimer's disease; neocortical stages V–VI: fully developed Alzheimer's disease). Whole mount techniques reveal the lesional pattern of the particularly severely involved superficial entorhinal layer as seen from the free surface of the parahippocampal gyrus.

	abstract = {We used a recently developed test of spatial memory—the Four Mountains Test—to investigate the core cognitive processes underpinning topographical disorientation in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Performance of these clinical groups was compared with age-matched controls, patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and patients with subjective memory impairments. We investigated the perception (concurrent match-to-sample) and short-term retention (2-s delayed match-to-sample) of the configuration of topographical features in computer-generated landscapes shown from different viewpoints. Thirty-one patients were tested (7 AD, 6 a-MCI, 7 temporal variant FTLD, 5 frontal variant FTLD, 6 subjective memory impairment) and 25 age- and gender-matched controls. Brain MRI was available for 27 patients; medial temporal lobe atrophy was assessed using a visual rating scale. Patients with a-MCI or mild AD were impaired on topographical short-term memory, but not perception. No other group differences were found on the topographical subtests. Notably, patients with temporal variants of FTLD performed normally, regardless of the laterality of damage. Subtests for the perception and retention of nonspatial aspects of the landscapes (weather conditions, seasonal and daily variations in lighting and color) were poor at differentiating the patient groups. These results indicate a core deficit in representing topographical layout, even for very short durations, within the context of more general long-term memory impairments found in AD, and suggest that this function is particularly sensitive to the earliest stages of the disease. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Further, we would investigate whether this deficit could be present in patients having AD without topographical disorientation (TD) signs in everyday life assessed through an informal interview to caregivers. Seven patients with AD and 20 healthy participants performed the Walking Corsi Test and the Corsi Block-Tapping Test. The former test requires memorizing a sequence of places by following a path and the latter is a well-known visuospatial memory task. Patients with AD also performed a verbal WM test to exclude the presence of general WM impairments. Preliminary results suggest that egocentric topographical WM is selectively impaired, with respect to visuospatial and verbal WM, even without TD suggesting an important role of this memory in the early stages of AD.},

	abstract = {Several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders share stress as a risk factor and are more prevalent in women than in men. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) orchestrates the stress response, and excessive CRF is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of these diseases. We previously found that the CRF1 receptor (CRF1) is sex biased whereby coupling to its GTP-binding protein, Gs, is greater in females, whereas β-arrestin-2 coupling is greater in males. This study used a phosphoproteomic approach in CRF-overexpressing (CRF-OE) mice to test the proof of principle that when CRF is in excess, sex-biased CRF1 coupling translates into divergent cell signaling that is expressed as different brain phosphoprotein profiles. Cortical phosphopeptides that distinguished female and male CRF-OE mice were overrepresented in unique pathways that were consistent with Gs-dependent signaling in females and β-arrestin-2 signaling in males. Notably, phosphopeptides that were more abundant in female CRF-OE mice were overrepresented in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathway. Phosphoproteomic results were validated by demonstrating that CRF overexpression in females was associated with increased tau phosphorylation and, in a mouse model of AD pathology, phosphorylation of β-secretase, the enzyme involved in the formation of amyloid β. These females exhibited increased formation of amyloid β plaques and cognitive impairments relative to males. Collectively, the findings are consistent with a mechanism whereby the excess CRF that characterizes stress-related diseases initiates distinct cellular processes in male and female brains, as a result of sex-biased CRF1 signaling. Promotion of AD-related signaling pathways through this mechanism may contribute to female vulnerability to AD.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slow, progressive neurodegenerative disease in which cognitive decline takes place over a period of several years with a very variable period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and, in some cases, relatively long period before progression to dementia. The cognitive deficit during MCI is probably due to neuronal loss, an intermediate level of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and synaptosis, which is interrupted with a transient compensatory increase. We found impairment in reference memory accompanied by a decrease in the expression of synaptophysin, β-III tubulin, and MAP2 and a trend for GluR1, at 12 weeks of age in 3xTg-AD mice (hAPPSwe, P301L tau, PS1 [M146V] knock-in), a widely used transgenic model of AD. Past 12 weeks, the cross-sectional analysis of different age groups showed a compensatory increase in synaptic markers relative to that in wild type animals in a topographic and time-dependent manner. When studied across time we found that in 3xTg-AD mice, the compensatory phenomenon occurred in parallel in different regions of the brain. However, this attempt of the brain to repair itself was able to only partially rescue cognitive impairment. These findings for the first time raise the intriguing possibility that AD causing mutated transgenes may initially cause an increase in synaptic and dendritic markers as a compensatory mechanism for synaptic deficit, and this phenomenon, though transient, could be the biological basis of the period of MCI seen in AD.},

Comparisons were made across the following three groups: Clinically normal without preclinical AD (n = 42), clinically normal with preclinical AD (n = 13), and early-stage symptomatic AD (n = 16) groups. Preclinical AD was defined based on cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 levels below 500 pg/ml. Preclinical AD was associated with deficits in the use of a wayfinding strategy, but not a route learning strategy. Moreover, post-hoc analyses indicated that wayfinding performance had moderate sensitivity and specificity. Results also confirmed early-stage symptomatic AD-related deficits in the use of both wayfinding and route learning strategies. The results of this study suggest that aspects of spatial navigation may be particularly sensitive at detecting the earliest cognitive deficits of AD.},

Abstract
Optogenetic control over neuronal firing has become an increasingly elegant method to dissect the microcircuitry of mammalian brains. To date, examination of these manipulations on neurotransmitter release has been minimal. Here we present the first in-depth analysis of optogenetic stimulation on dopamine neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum of urethane-anesthetized rats. By combining the tight spatial and temporal resolution of both optogenetics and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry we have determined the parameters necessary to control phasic dopamine release in the dorsal striatum of rats in vivo. The kinetics of optically induced dopamine release mirror established models of electrically evoked release, indicating that potential artifacts of electrical stimulation on ion channels and the dopamine transporter are negligible. Furthermore a lack of change in extracellular pH indicates that optical stimulation does not alter blood flow. Optical control over dopamine release is highly reproducible and flexible. We are able to repeatedly evoke concentrations of dopamine release as small as a single dopamine transient (50 nM). An inverted U-shaped frequency response curve exists with maximal stimulation inducing dopamine effluxes exceeding 500 nM. Taken together, these results have obvious implications for understanding the neurobiological basis of dopaminergic-based disorders and provide the framework to effectively manipulate dopamine patterns.},

	abstract = {Maintaining a sense of direction requires combining information from static environmental landmarks with dynamic information about self-motion. This is accomplished by the head direction system, whose neurons – head direction cells – encode specific head directions. When the brain integrates information in sensory domains, this process is almost always ‘optimal’ – that is, inputs are weighted according to their reliability. Evidence suggests cue combination by head direction cells may also be optimal. The simplicity of the head direction signal, together with the detailed knowledge we have about the anatomy and physiology of the underlying circuit, therefore makes this system a tractable model with which to discover how optimal cue combination occurs at a neural level. In the head direction system, cue interactions are thought to occur on an attractor network of interacting head direction neurons, but attractor dynamics predict a winner-take-all decision between cues, rather than optimal combination. However, optimal cue combination in an attractor could be achieved via plasticity in the feedforward connections from external sensory cues (i.e. the landmarks) onto the ring attractor. Short-term plasticity would allow rapid re-weighting that adjusts the final state of the network in accordance with cue reliability (reflected in the connection strengths), while longer term plasticity would allow long-term learning about this reliability. Although these principles were derived to model the head direction system, they could potentially serve to explain optimal cue combination in other sensory systems more generally.},

In the literature, the ProS (in primate) and PoS (in rodent) are inconstantly identified, making data comparison difficult across species. This review is an attempt to discuss equivalencies and extent of the five subicular components in human, monkey, and rodent based on available information on their cytoarchitecture, chemoarchitecture, molecular signature, and neural connectivity. All five subicular cortices exist in human, monkey, and rodent. In human and monkey, the ProS and Sub extend into the uncal region anteriorly, and the PoS and PaS reach the cingulate isthmus posteriorly. In rodent, most of the typical subicular cortices are located in the dorsal and caudal portions of the hippocampal formation, and the modified version of the ventral ProS and Sub corresponds to the modified description of the uncal ProS and Sub in monkey and human. An interesting triangular region in rodent located at the juncture of the PoS, PaS, retrosplenial cortex, and visual cortex appears to be the equivalent of the monkey area prostriata. Major connections of the five subicular cortices are also summarized based on unified criteria discussed in this review, with distinct connections revealed between the ProS and the Sub. J. Comp.

Here we review recent work on the use of one such transformative tool in behavioral neuroscience research, chemogenetics (or Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs, DREADDS). As transformative technologies such as DREADDs are introduced, applied, and refined, their utility in addressing complex questions about behavior and cognition becomes clear and exciting. In the behavioral neuroscience field, remarkable new findings now regularly appear as a result of the ability to monitor and intervene in neural processes with high anatomical precision as animals behave in complex task environments. As these new tools are applied to behavioral questions, individualized procedures for their use find their way into diverse labs. Thus, 'tips of the trade' become important for wide dissemination not only for laboratories that are using the tools but also for those who are interested in incorporating them into their own work. Our aim is to provide an up-to-date perspective on how the DREADD technique is being used for research on learning and memory, decision making, and goal-directed behavior, as well as to provide suggestions and considerations for current and future users based on our collective experience.

Both transgenic and non-genetically modified mouse models enable access to different types of AD-like pathology in vivo. Although there is a wealth of genetic and biochemical studies on proposed AD pathogenic pathways, as a disease that centrally features cognitive failure, the ultimate readout for any interventions should be measures of learning and memory. This is particularly important given the lack of knowledge on disease etiology – assessment by cognitive assays offers the advantage of targeting relevant memory systems without requiring assumptions about pathogenesis. A multitude of behavioral assays are available for assessing cognitive functioning in mouse models, including ones specific for hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Here we review the basics of available transgenic and non-transgenic AD mouse models and detail three well-established behavioral tasks commonly used for testing hippocampal-dependent cognition in mice – contextual fear conditioning, radial arm water maze and Morris water maze. In particular, we discuss the practical considerations, requirements and caveats of these behavioral testing paradigms.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is emerging as the most prevalent and socially disruptive illness of aging populations, as more people live long enough to become affected. Although AD is placing a considerable and increasing burden on society, it represents the largest unmet medical need in neurology, because current drugs improve symptoms, but do not have profound disease-modifying effects. Although AD pathogenesis is multifaceted and difficult to pinpoint, genetic and cell biological studies led to the amyloid hypothesis, which posits that amyloid β (Aβ) plays a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis. Amyloid precursor protein (APP), as well as β- and γ-secretases are the principal players involved in Aβ production, while α-secretase cleavage on APP prevents Aβ deposition. The association of early onset familial AD with mutations in the APP and γ-secretase components provided a potential tool of generating animal models of the disease. However, a model that recapitulates all the aspects of AD has not yet been produced. Here, we face the problem of modeling AD pathology describing several models, which have played a major role in defining critical disease-related mechanisms and in exploring novel potential therapeutic approaches. In particular, we will provide an extensive overview on the distinct features and pros and contras of different AD models, ranging from invertebrate to rodent models and finally dealing with computational models and induced pluripotent stem cells.},

	abstract = {The goal of this review is to discuss how behavioral tests in mice relate to the pathological and neuropsychological features seen in human Alzheimer's disease (AD), and present a comprehensive analysis of the temporal progression of behavioral impairments in commonly used AD mouse models that contain mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP). We begin with a brief overview of the neuropathological changes seen in the AD brain and an outline of some of the clinical neuropsychological assessments used to measure cognitive deficits associated with the disease. This is followed by a critical assessment of behavioral tasks that are used in AD mice to model the cognitive changes seen in the human disease. Behavioral tests discussed include spatial memory tests [Morris water maze (MWM), radial arm water maze (RAWM), Barnes maze], associative learning tasks (passive avoidance, fear conditioning), alternation tasks (Y-Maze/T-Maze), recognition memory tasks (Novel Object Recognition), attentional tasks (3 and 5 choice serial reaction time), set-shifting tasks, and reversal learning tasks. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of these behavioral tasks, and how they may correlate with clinical assessments in humans. Finally, the temporal progression of both cognitive and non-cognitive deficits in 10 AD mouse models (PDAPP, TG2576, APP23, TgCRND8, J20, APP/PS1, TG2576 + PS1 (M146L), APP/PS1 KI, 5×FAD, and 3×Tg-AD) are discussed in detail. Mouse models of AD and the behavioral tasks used in conjunction with those models are immensely important in contributing to our knowledge of disease progression and are a useful tool to study AD pathophysiology and the resulting cognitive deficits. However, investigators need to be aware of the potential weaknesses of the available preclinical models in terms of their ability to model cognitive changes observed in human AD. It is our hope that this review will assist investigators in selecting an appropriate mouse model, and accompanying behavioral paradigms to investigate different aspects of AD pathology and disease progression.},

We tested whether SN performance, self-centered (egocentric) and world-centered (allocentric), was distinguishable from performance on established cognitive functions—verbal and nonverbal memory, executive and visuospatial function, attention/working memory, and language function. 108 older adults (53 cognitively normal [CN] and 55 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI]) underwent neuropsychological examination and real-space navigation testing. Subset (n = 63) had automated hippocampal volumetry. In a factor analysis, allocentric and egocentric navigation tasks loaded highly onto the same factor with low loadings on other factors comprising other cognitive functions. In linear regression, performance on other cognitive functions was not, or was only marginally, associated with spatial navigation performance in CN or aMCI groups. After adjustment for age, gender, and education, right hippocampal volume explained 26\% of the variance in allocentric navigation in aMCI group. In conclusion, spatial navigation, a known cognitive marker of early AD, may be distinguished from other cognitive functions. Therefore, its assessment along with other major cognitive functions may be highly beneficial in terms of obtaining a comprehensive neuropsychological profile.},

In addition, there were activity differences along the rostro-caudal axis of both subregions. Two groups of rats were trained on a working memory task in a radial-arm maze, one group in the light, the other in the dark. Each working memory group had two sets of yoked controls. Working memory consistently increased retrosplenial immediate-early gene activity (c-fos and zif268 ), although systematic differences occurred in the granular and dysgranular subregions. Both c-fos and zif268 expression increased in granular cortex irrespective of whether the spatial memory task was in the light or dark. In contrast, only in the light did spatial memory increase dysgranular cortex activation. Correlations based on the counts of Fos-positive cells helped to reinforce the particular association between the dysgranular retrosplenial cortex and radial-arm maze performance in the light. These results provide clear evidence for proposed functional differences between the major retrosplenial subregions: the granular cortex contributes to spatial learning and navigation based on both internal and external cues (light and dark), while dysgranular cortex is more selectively involved when distal visual cues control performance (light only).},

Although these areas also make complex interconnections that constitute part of a neural circuit subserving various functions, such as spatial memory and navigation, the details of such interconnections have not been studied comprehensively. In the study reported here, we investigated the organization of associational and commissural connections of areas 29a–d within the retrosplenial cortex in the rat, using the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit and anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine. The results demonstrated that each of these areas has a distinct set of interconnections within the retrosplenial cortex. Each area interconnects strongly along the transverse axis of the retrosplenial cortex: area 29a, area 29b, caudal area 29c, and caudal area 29d connect with each other, and rostral area 29c and rostral area 29d connect with each other. In the longitudinal direction, rostral-to-caudal projections from rostral areas 29c and 29d to areas 29a and 29b and caudal areas 29c and 29d are strong, whereas reciprocal caudal-to-rostral projections are relatively weak. Although most of the intrinsic connections are homotopical, contralateral connections are weaker and less extensive than ipsilateral connections. These findings suggest that each retrosplenial area may not only process specific information somewhat independently but that it may also integrate and transmit such information through intrinsic connections to other areas in order to achieve retrosplenial cortical functions, such as spatial memory and learning.},

Thus bilateral damage to the retrosplenial cortex results in deficits in reversal learning that are highly similar to those observed after bilateral hippocampectomy. These findings are interpreted within a conceptual framework that characterizes multisynaptic projections from the hippocampus to the retrosplenial cortex, and ultimately to the cerebellum, as responsible for the behavioral expression of learning-related changes in hippocampal pyramidal cell activity.},

Consistent with this, substantial behavioral evidence indicates that RSC is essential for consolidating and/or retrieving contextual and spatial memories. In addition, there is growing evidence that RSC neurons undergo activity-dependent plastic changes during memory formation and retrieval. In this paper we review both the behavioral and cellular/molecular data and posit that the RSC has a particularly important role in the storage and retrieval of spatial and contextual memories perhaps due its involvement in binding together multiple cues in the environment. We identify remaining questions and avenues for future research that take advantage of emerging methods to selectively manipulate RSC neurons both spatially and temporally and to image the RSC in awake, behaving animals.},

In contrast, RSC appears to have little involvement with delay fear conditioning to an auditory cue. However, all previous studies have examined the contribution of the RSC to recently acquired auditory fear memories. Since neocortical regions have been implicated in the permanent storage of remote memories, we examined the contribution of the RSC to remotely acquired auditory fear memories. In Experiment 1, retrieval of a remotely acquired auditory fear memory was impaired when permanent lesions (either electrolytic or neurotoxic) were made several weeks after initial conditioning. In Experiment 2, using a chemogenetic approach, we observed impairments in the retrieval of remote memory for an auditory cue when the RSC was temporarily inactivated during testing. In Experiment 3, after injection of a retrograde tracer into the RSC, we observed labeled cells in primary and secondary auditory cortices, as well as the claustrum, indicating that the RSC receives direct projections from auditory regions. Overall our results indicate the RSC has a critical role in the retrieval of remotely acquired auditory fear memories, and we suggest this is related to the quality of the memory, with less precise memories being RSC dependent.},

Although the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is known to be involved in contextual fear conditioning, it is not clear whether it contributes to the elemental or configural system. To isolate the role of the RSC in contextual fear conditioning, the current experiments examined the influence of RSC lesions on the context preexposure facilitation effect, a procedure known to produce conditioning to a configural representation of context. In Experiment 1, rats that were preexposed to the conditioning context froze more compared to rats that were not, replicating the context preexposure facilitation effect. Although pretraining lesions of the RSC had no impact on the context preexposure facilitation effect (Experiment 2a), posttraining lesions attenuated the effect (Experiment 2b), suggesting that the RSC normally contributes to a configural context representation. Retrohippocampal contributions to contextual fear conditioning are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

This is consistent with its well-established connectivity; the RSC is located at the interface of visuo-spatial association areas and the parahippocampal–hippocampal memory system. However, the RSC also contributes to learning and memory for discrete cues. For example, both permanent lesions and temporary inactivation of the RSC have been shown to impair sensory preconditioning, a form of higher-order conditioning. The purpose of the present experiment was to examine the role of the RSC in a closely related higher-order conditioning paradigm: second-order conditioning. Sham and RSC lesioned rats received first-order conditioning in which one visual stimulus (V1) was paired with footshock and one visual stimulus (V2) was not. Following first-order conditioning, one auditory stimulus (A1) was then paired with V1 and a second auditory stimulus (A2) was paired with V2. Although lesions of the RSC impaired the first-order discrimination, they had no impact on the acquisition of second-order conditioning. Thus, the RSC does not appear necessary for acquisition/expression of second-order fear conditioning. The role of the RSC in higher-order conditioning, as well as a possible dissociation from the hippocampus, is discussed.},

The RSC contains head direction cells and connects to the parahippocampal region and anterior thalamus. Manipulations of the RSC can affect spatial and contextual tasks. A considerable amount of evidence implicates the role of the RSC in spatial navigation, but it is unclear whether this structure actually encodes or stores spatial information. We used a transgenic mouse in which the expression of green fluorescent protein was under the control of the immediate early gene c-fos promoter as well as time-lapse two-photon in vivo imaging to monitor neuronal activation triggered by spatial learning in the Morris water maze. We uncovered a repetitive pattern of cell activation in the RSC consistent with the hypothesis that during spatial learning an experience-dependent memory trace is formed in this structure. In support of this hypothesis, we also report three other observations. First, temporary RSC inactivation disrupts performance in a spatial learning task. Second, we show that overexpressing the transcription factor CREB in the RSC with a viral vector, a manipulation known to enhance memory consolidation in other circuits, results in spatial memory enhancements. Third, silencing the viral CREB-expressing neurons with the allatostatin system occludes the spatial memory enhancement. Taken together, these results indicate that the retrosplenial cortex engages in the formation and storage of memory traces for spatial information.},

For example, retrosplenial lesions appear to have little or no effect on standard tests of spatial alternation. To examine these differences, the current study sought to determine whether the retrosplenial cortex is important for just one spatial cue type (e.g., allocentric, directional or intra-maze cues) or whether the retrosplenial cortex helps the animal switch between competing spatial strategies or competing cue types. Using T-maze alternation, retrosplenial lesion rats were challenged with situations in which the available spatial information between the sample and test phases was changed, so taxing the interaction between different cue types. Clear lesion deficits emerged when intra- and extra-maze cues were placed in conflict (by rotating the maze between the sample and choice phases), or when the animals were tested in the dark in a double-maze. Finally, temporary inactivation of the retrosplenial cortex by muscimol infusions resulted in a striking deficit on standard T-maze alternation, indicating that, over time, other sites may be able to compensate for the loss of the retrosplenial cortex. This pattern of results is consistent with the impoverished use of both allocentric and directional information, exacerbated by an impaired ability to switch between different cue types.},

To characterize synaptic transmission in this pathway, we placed stimulating electrodes in the LDN and recorded fEPSPs elicited in the postsubiculum of urethane-anesthetized rats. LDN stimulation elicited a source-sink dipole between the deep and superficial layers of the postsubiculum, respectively, consistent with anatomical evidence for the termination of thalamic afferents in the superficial layers of the structure, and the existence of deep layer neurons with apical dendrites extending into these layers. Postsubicular fEPSPs were typically 0.5–1.0 mV in amplitude, with a peak latency of approximately 6 ms. Consistent with anatomical observations, the short onset latency of fEPSPs elicited by LDN stimulation, and their ability to follow a 60-Hz train of stimulation, indicate that the projection is monosynaptic. Paired-pulse stimulation revealed pronounced paired-pulse depression that was maximal at 100 ms, suggesting that initial release probabilities are high at LDN-postsubiculum synapses, in common with many neocortical pathways. A conventional tetanus protocol that yields LTP in hippocampal pathways had no effect on postsubicular fEPSPs, but long-term depression could be induced by 60-Hz stimulation. Drug infusion studies revealed that synaptic transmission in the LDN-postsubiculum projection is predominantly AMPA-receptor mediated. Rats were implanted with indwelling infusion cannulae targeting the postsubiculum, and, after a recovery period, were anaesthetized withurethane, and implanted with stimulating and recording electrodes. Infusion of CNQX almost completely abolished postsubicular fEPSPs, whereas D-AP5 had little effect. However, 60-Hz LTD was blocked by D-AP5 infusion, revealing that this form of synaptic plasticity is NMDA-receptor dependent. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The presubiculum (PrS) is part of an interconnected network of distributed brain regions where individual neurons signal the animals heading direction. PrS sends axons to medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), it is reciprocally connected with anterior thalamic nuclei (ATNs), and it sends feedback projections to the lateral mammillary nucleus (LMN), involved in generating the head direction signal. The intrinsic properties of projecting neurons will influence the pathway-specific transmission of activity. Here, we used projection-specific labeling of presubicular neurons to identify MEC-, LMN-, and ATN-projecting neurons in mice. MEC-projecting neurons located in superficial layers II/III were mostly regular spiking pyramidal neurons, and we also identified a Martinotti-type GABAergic neuron. The cell bodies of LMN-projecting neurons were located in a well-delimited area in the middle portion of the PrS, which corresponds to layer IV. The physiology of LMN projecting, pyramidal neurons stood out with a tendency to fire in bursts of action potentials (APs) with rapid onset. These properties may be uniquely adapted to reliably transmit visual landmark information with short latency to upstream LMN. Neurons projecting to ATN were located in layers V/VI, and they were mostly regular spiking pyramidal neurons. Unsupervised cluster analysis of intrinsic properties suggested distinct physiological features for the different categories of projection neurons, with some similarities between MEC- and ATN-projecting neurons. Projection-specific subpopulations may serve separate functions in the PrS and may be engaged differently in transmitting head direction related information.},

Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) constitute a powerful chemogenetic strategy that can modulate nerve cell activity in freely moving animal preparations. Gomez et al. used radioligand receptor occupancy measurements and in vivo positron emission tomography to show that DREADDs expressed in the brain are not activated by the designer compound CNO (clozapine N-oxide). Instead, they are activated by the CNO metabolite clozapine, a drug with multiple endogenous targets. This may have important implications for the interpretation of results obtained with this popular technology.
Science, this issue p. 503
The chemogenetic technology DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) is widely used for remote manipulation of neuronal activity in freely moving animals. DREADD technology posits the use of “designer receptors,” which are exclusively activated by the “designer drug” clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not enter the brain after systemic drug injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs. Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency. Upon systemic CNO injections, converted clozapine readily enters the brain and occupies central nervous system–expressed DREADDs, whereas systemic subthreshold clozapine injections induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors.
Metabolically derived clozapine is the in vivo actuator of designer drug receptors expressed in the central nervous system.

Confidence intervals for Cohen's d as measure of effect size were computed and tested for equivalence with 0.2 as equivalence margin. Despite the large sample size, only few behavioral parameters showed a significant sex effect on CV. Confidence intervals of effect size indicated that CV was either equivalent or showed a small sex difference at most, accounting for less than 2\% of total group to group variation of CV. While female mice were potentially slightly more variable in water-maze acquisition and in the open field, males tended to perform less reliably in the water-maze probe trial. In addition to evaluating variability, we also directly compared mean performance of female and male mice and found them to be equivalent in both water-maze place navigation and open field exploration. Our data confirm and extend other large scale studies in demonstrating that including female mice in experiments does not cause a relevant increase of data variability. Our results make a strong case for including mice of both sexes whenever open field or water-maze are used in preclinical research.},

	abstract = {, Neuroscience research has historically ignored female animals. This neglect comes in two general forms. The first is sex bias, defined as favoring one sex over another; in this case, male over female. The second is sex omission, which is the lack of reporting sex. The recognition of this phenomenon has generated fierce debate across the sciences. Here we test whether sex bias and omission are still present in the neuroscience literature, whether studies employing both males and females neglect sex as an experimental variable, and whether sex bias and omission differs between animal models and journals. To accomplish this, we analyzed the largest-ever number of neuroscience articles for sex bias and omission: 6636 articles using mice or rats in 6 journals published from 2010 to 2014. Sex omission is declining, as increasing numbers of articles report sex. Sex bias remains present, as increasing numbers of articles report the sole use of males. Articles using both males and females are also increasing, but few report assessing sex as an experimental variable. Sex bias and omission varies substantially by animal model and journal. These findings are essential for understanding the complex status of sex bias and omission in neuroscience research and may inform effective decisions regarding policy action.},

New studies have shown that place cells are part of a broader circuit for dynamic representation of self-location. A key component of this network is the entorhinal grid cells, which, by virtue of their tessellating firing fields, may provide the elements of a path integration–based neural map. Here we review how place cells and grid cells may form the basis for quantitative spatiotemporal representation of places, routes, and associated experiences during behavior and in memory. Because these cell types have some of the most conspicuous behavioral correlates among neurons in nonsensory cortical systems, and because their spatial firing structure reflects computations internally in the system, studies of entorhinal-hippocampal representations may offer considerable insight into general principles of cortical network dynamics.},

	abstract = {This paper is a study of the behavioral and spatial firing correlates of neurons in the rat postsubiculum. Recordings were made from postsubicular neurons as rats moved freely throughout a cylindrical chamber, where the major cue for orientation was a white card taped to the inside wall. An automatic video/computer system monitored cell discharge while simultaneously tracking the position of 2 colored light emitting diodes (LEDs) secured to the animal's head. The animal's location was calculated from the position of one of the LEDs and head direction in the horizontal plane calculated from the relative positions of the 2 LEDs. Approximately 26\% of the cells were classified as head-direction cells because they discharged as a function of the animal's head direction in the horizontal plane, independent of the animal's behavior, location, or trunk position. For each head-direction cell, vectors drawn in the direction of maximal firing were parallel throughout the recording chamber and did not converge toward a single point. Plots of firing rate versus head direction showed that each firing-rate/head-direction function was adequately described by a triangular function. Each cell's maximum firing rate occurred at only one (the preferred) head direction; firing rates at head directions on either side of the preferred direction decreased linearly with angular deviation from the preferred direction. Results from 24 head-direction cells in 7 animals showed an equal distribution of preferred firing directions over a 360 degrees angle. The peak firing rate of head-direction cells varied from 5 to 115 spikes/sec (mean: 35). The range of head-direction angles over which discharge was elevated (directional firing range) was usually about 90 degrees, with little, if any, discharge at head directions outside this range. Quantitative analysis showed the location of the animal within the cylinder had minimal effect on directional cell firing. For each head-direction cell, the preferred direction, peak firing rate, and directional firing range remained stable for days. These results identify a new cell type that signals the animal's head direction in its environment.},

Representations of location and direction in the brain, such as head direction cells, grid cells, and place cells in the limbic system, are thought to underlie navigation by path integration. While this idea is generally consistent with lesion studies, the relationship between such neural activity and behavior has not been studied on a task where animals demonstrably use a path integration strategy. Here we report the development of such a task in rats: by slowly rotating rats before their return to a trial-unique home base, we could show subjects relied on internal cues only to navigate. To illustrate how this task can be combined with recording, we show examples of simultaneously recorded head direction cells in which neural activity is closely related to rats' homing direction. These results support the notion that rats can navigate by path integration, that this ability depends on head direction cells, and suggest a convenient behavioral paradigm for investigating the neural basis of navigation.},

In a navigational task requiring the use of internal cues to return to a home base location without vision (path integration), we found a robust correlation between HD cell activity and the rat's heading error in their homing behaviour. Furthermore, we observed two different correction processes that animals used to improve performance after an error. The more frequent one consists of `resetting' the cell whenever the animal returns to the home location. However, we found that when large errors occur the HD system has the ability to `remap' and set a new reference frame, which is then used in subsequent trials. We also offer some insight into how these two correction processes operate when animals make an error.},

	abstract = {Accurate navigation depends on a network of neural systems that encode the moment-to-moment changes in an animal’s directional orientation and location in space. Within this navigation system are head direction (HD) cells, which fire persistently when an animal’s head is pointed in a particular direction (Sharp et al., 2001a; Taube, 2007). HD cells are widely thought to underlie an animal’s sense of spatial orientation, and research over the last 25+ years has revealed that this robust spatial signal is widely distributed across subcortical and cortical limbic areas. Much of this work has been directed at understanding the functional organization of the HD cell circuitry, and precisely how this signal is generated from sensory and motor systems. The purpose of the present review is to summarize some of the recent studies arguing that the HD cell circuit is largely processed in a hierarchical fashion, following a pathway involving the dorsal tegmental nuclei → lateral mammillary nuclei → anterior thalamus → parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortical regions. We also review recent work identifying “bursting” cellular activity in the HD cell circuit after lesions of the vestibular system, and relate these observations to the long held view that attractor network mechanisms underlie HD signal generation. Finally, we summarize the work to date suggesting that this network architecture may reside within the tegmento-mammillary circuit.},

Levels of inflammatory mediators in circulation are known to increase with age, but the underlying cause of this age-associated inflammation is debated. We find that, when maintained under germ-free conditions, mice do not display an age-related increase in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. A higher proportion of germ-free mice live to 600 days than their conventional counterparts, and macrophages derived from aged germ-free mice maintain anti-microbial activity. Co-housing germ-free mice with old, but not young, conventionally raised mice increases pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood. In tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-deficient mice, which are protected from age-associated inflammation, age-related microbiota changes are not observed. Furthermore, age-associated microbiota changes can be reversed by reducing TNF using anti-TNF therapy. These data suggest that aging-associated microbiota promote inflammation and that reversing these age-related microbiota changes represents a potential strategy for reducing age-associated inflammation and the accompanying morbidity.},

	abstract = {Microglia are the resident macrophage-like population in the CNS. Microglia remain quiescent until injury or infection activates the cells to perform effector inflammatory and APC functions. Our previous studies have shown that microglia infected with a neurotropic strain of Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus secreted innate immune cytokines and up-regulated costimulatory molecules and MHC class II, enabling the cells to present viral and myelin Ags to CD4+ T cells. Recently, TLRs have been shown to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and initiate innate immune responses upon interaction with infectious agents. We examined TLR expression on brain microglia and their functional responses upon stimulation with various TLR agonists. We report that mouse microglia express mRNA for all of the recently identified TLRs, TLR1–9, used for recognition of bacterial and viral molecular patterns. Furthermore, stimulation of quiescent microglia with various TLR agonists, including LPS (TLR4), peptidoglycan (TLR2), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (TLR3), CpG DNA (TLR9), and infection with viable Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus, activated the cells to up-regulate unique patterns of innate and effector immune cytokines and chemokines at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, TLR stimulation activated up-regulation of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, enabling the microglia to efficiently present myelin Ags to CD4+ T cells. Thus, microglia appear to be a unique and important component of both the innate and adaptive immune response, providing the CNS with a means to rapidly and efficiently respond to a wide variety of pathogens.},

	abstract = {The innate immune system of plants recognizes microbial pathogens and terminates their growth. However, recent findings suggest that at least one layer of this system is also engaged in cooperative plant-microbe interactions and influences host colonization by beneficial microbial communities. This immune layer involves sensing of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that initiate quantitative immune responses to control host-microbial load, whereas diversification of MAMPs and PRRs emerges as a mechanism that locally sculpts microbial assemblages in plant populations. This suggests a more complex microbial management role of the innate immune system for controlled accommodation of beneficial microbes and in pathogen elimination. The finding that similar molecular strategies are deployed by symbionts and pathogens to dampen immune responses is consistent with this hypothesis but implies different selective pressures on the immune system due to contrasting outcomes on plant fitness. The reciprocal interplay between microbiota and the immune system likely plays a critical role in shaping beneficial plant-microbiota combinations and maintaining microbial homeostasis.},

However, what drives amyloid buildup in sporadic nongenetic cases of AD is still unknown. AD brains feature an inflammatory reaction around amyloid plaques, and a specific subset of the gut microbiota (GMB) may promote brain inflammation. We investigated the possible role of the GMB in AD pathogenesis by studying the association of brain amyloidosis with (1) GMB taxa with pro- and anti-inflammatory activity; and (2) peripheral inflammation in cognitively impaired patients. We measured the stool abundance of selected bacterial GMB taxa (\textit{Escherichia/Shigella}, \textit{Pseudomonas aeruginosa}, \textit{Eubacterium rectale}, \textit{Eubacterium hallii}, \textit{Faecalibacterium prausnitzii}, and \textit{Bacteroides fragilis}) and the blood expression levels of cytokines (pro-inflammatory cytokines: CXCL2, CXCL10, interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, IL-18, IL-8, inflammasome complex (NLRP3), tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α]; anti-inflammatory cytokines: IL-4, IL-10, IL-13) in cognitively impaired patients with (\textit{n} = 40, Amy+) and with no brain amyloidosis (\textit{n} = 33, Amy−) and also in a group of controls (\textit{n} = 10, no brain amyloidosis and no cognitive impairment). Amy+ patients showed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CXCL2, NLRP3, and IL-1β) compared with both controls and with Amy− patients. A reduction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was observed in Amy+ versus Amy−. Amy+ showed lower abundance of \textit{E. rectale} and higher abundance of \textit{Escherichia/Shigella} compared with both healthy controls (fold change, FC = −9.6, \textit{p} {\textless} 0.001 and FC = +12.8, \textit{p} {\textless} 0.001, respectively) and to Amy− (FC = −7.7, \textit{p} {\textless} 0.001 and FC = +7.4, \textit{p} = 0.003). A positive correlation was observed between pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, NLRP3, and CXCL2 with abundance of the inflammatory bacteria taxon \textit{Escherichia/Shigella} (rho = 0.60, \textit{p} {\textless} 0.001; rho = 0.57, \textit{p} {\textless} 0.001; and rho = 0.30, \textit{p} = 0.007, respectively) and a negative correlation with the anti-inflammatory \textit{E. rectale} (rho = −0.48, \textit{p} {\textless} 0.001; rho = −0.25, \textit{p} = 0.024; rho = −0.49, \textit{p} {\textless} 0.001). Our data indicate that an increase in the abundance of a pro-inflammatory GMB taxon, \textit{Escherichia/Shigella}, and a reduction in the abundance of an anti-inflammatory taxon, \textit{E. rectale}, are possibly associated with a peripheral inflammatory state in patients with cognitive impairment and brain amyloidosis. A possible causal relation between GMB-related inflammation and amyloidosis deserves further investigation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Degeneration of central cholinergic neurons impairs memory, and enhancement of cholinergic synapses improves cognitive processes. Cholinergic signaling is also anti-inflammatory, and neuroinflammation is increasingly linked to adverse memory, especially in Alzheimer’s disease. Much of the evidence surrounding cholinergic impacts on the neuroimmune system focuses on the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, as stimulation of this receptor prevents many of the effects of immune activation. Microglia and astrocytes both express this receptor, so it is possible that some cholinergic effects may be via these non-neuronal cells. Though the presence of microglia is required for memory, overactivated microglia due to an immune challenge overproduce inflammatory cytokines, which is adverse for memory. Blocking these exaggerated effects, specifically by decreasing the release of cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, has been shown to prevent inflammation-induced memory impairment. While there is considerable evidence that cholinergic signaling improves memory, fewer studies have linked the “cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway” to memory processes. This review will summarize the current understanding of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway as it relates to memory, and will argue that one mechanism by which the cholinergic system modulates hippocampal memory processes is its influence on neuroimmune function via the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.},

	abstract = {Cerebrovascular dysfunction is rapidly reemerging as a major process of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It is, therefore, crucial to delineate the roles of AD risk factors in cerebrovascular dysfunction. While apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), Amyloid-β (Aβ), and peripheral inflammation independently induce cerebrovascular damage, their collective effects remain to be elucidated. The goal of this study was to determine the interactive effect of APOE4, Aβ, and chronic repeated peripheral inflammation on cerebrovascular and cognitive dysfunction in vivo. EFAD mice are a well-characterized mouse model that express human APOE3 (E3FAD) or APOE4 (E4FAD) and overproduce human Aβ42 via expression of 5 Familial Alzheimer’s disease (5xFAD) mutations. Here, we utilized EFAD carriers [5xFAD+/−/APOE+/+ (EFAD+)] and noncarriers [5xFAD−/−/APOE+/+ (EFAD−)] to compare the effects of peripheral inflammation in the presence or absence of human Aβ overproduction. Low-level, chronic repeated peripheral inflammation was induced in EFAD mice via systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.5 mg/kg/wk i.p.) from 4 to 6 months of age. In E4FAD+ mice, peripheral inflammation caused cognitive deficits and lowered post-synaptic protein levels. Importantly, cerebrovascular deficits were observed in LPS-challenged E4FAD+ mice, including cerebrovascular leakiness, lower vessel coverage, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy-like Aβ deposition. Thus, APOE4, Aβ, and peripheral inflammation interact to induce cerebrovascular damage and cognitive deficits.},

	abstract = {Objectives Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. This study quantitatively summarised the data on peripheral inflammatory markers in patients with AD compared with healthy controls (HC).

Methods Original reports containing measurements of peripheral inflammatory markers in AD patients and HC were included for meta-analysis. Standardised mean differences were calculated using a random effects model. Meta-regression and exploration of heterogeneity was performed using publication year, age, gender, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, plasma versus serum measurements and immunoassay type.

Results A total of 175 studies were combined to review 51 analytes in 13 344 AD and 12 912 HC patients. Elevated peripheral interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-18, interferon-γ, homocysteine, high-sensitivity C reactive protein, C-X-C motif chemokine-10, epidermal growth factor, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α converting enzyme, soluble TNF receptors 1 and 2, α1-antichymotrypsin and decreased IL-1 receptor antagonist and leptin were found in patients with AD compared with HC. IL-6 levels were inversely correlated with mean MMSE scores.

Conclusions These findings suggest that AD is accompanied by a peripheral inflammatory response and that IL-6 may be a useful biological marker to correlate with the severity of cognitive impairment. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of these markers.},

In each experiment, HD cells were recorded in the rat anterodorsal thalamus while they foraged for randomly scattered food in trapezoid- and rectangle-shaped environments. After an initial recording session, each environment was rotated 90°, and changes in the preferred firing directions of HD cells were monitored. Rats were disoriented before each test session to prevent the use of self-movement cues to maintain orientation from one session to the next. In Experiment 1, we demonstrate that HD cell tuning consistently shifted in register with the trapezoid shaped enclosure, but was more variable in the rectangle shaped environment. In Experiments 2 and 3, we show that the strong control by the trapezoid persists in the presence of one clearly visible distal landmark, but not when three or more distal landmarks, including view of the recording room, are present. Together, the results indicate that distinct environmental boundaries exert strong stimulus control over HD cell orientation. However, this geometric control can be overridden with a sufficient number of salient distal landmarks. These results stand in contrast to the view that information from geometric cues usually takes precedence over information from landmark cues. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Cells within several limbic system areas of the mammalian brain discharge allocentrically as a function of the animal's directional heading, independent of the animal's location and ongoing behavior. These cells are referred to as head direction (HD) cells and are believed to encode the animal's perceived directional heading with respect to its environment. Although HD cells are found in several areas, the principal circuit for generating this signal originates in the dorsal tegmental nucleus and projects serially, with some reciprocal connections, to the lateral mammillary nucleus → anterodorsal thalamus → PoS, and terminates in the entorhinal cortex. HD cells receive multimodal information about landmarks and self-generated movements. Vestibular information appears critical for generating the directional signal, but motor/proprioceptive and landmark information are important for updating it.},

	abstract = {Summary
The earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are characterized by the formation of mature tangles in the entorhinal cortex and disorientation and confusion when navigating familiar places. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) contains specialized neurons called grid cells that form part of the spatial navigation system. Here we show in a transgenic mouse model expressing mutant human tau predominantly in the EC that the formation of mature tangles in old mice was associated with excitatory cell loss and deficits in grid cell function, including destabilized grid fields and reduced firing rates, as well as altered network activity. Overt tau pathology in the aged mice was accompanied by spatial memory deficits. Therefore, tau pathology initiated in the entorhinal cortex could lead to deficits in grid cell firing and underlie the deterioration of spatial cognition seen in human AD.},

	abstract = {Animals occupy territories in which resources such as food and shelter are often distributed unevenly. While studies of exploratory behavior have typically involved the laboratory rodent as an experimental subject, questions regarding what constitutes exploration have dominated. A recent line of research has utilized a descriptive approach to the study of rodent exploration, which has revealed that this behavior is organized into movement subsystems that can be readily quantified. The movements include home base behavior, which serves as a central point of attraction from which rats and mice organize exploratory trips into the remaining environment. In this review, we describe some of the features of this organized behavior pattern as well as its modulation by sensory cues and previous experience. We conclude the review by summarizing research investigating the neurobiological bases of exploration, which we hope will stimulate renewed interest and research on the neural systems mediating these behaviors.},

We inactivated or lesioned the ATN and subsequently recorded single units in the entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum. ATN manipulation significantly disrupted grid and HD cell characteristics while sparing theta rhythmicity in these regions.These results indicate that the HD signal via the ATN is necessary for the generation and function of grid cell activity.},

	abstract = {The parietothalamic projections have been shown to be heterogeneous and appear to be a reflection of the detailed architectonic parcellation of the parietal lobe. In the present study WGA-HRP injections were placed in the different subdivisions of the posterior parietal cortex of the rhesus monkey to determine whether a similarly complex pattern also exists in the thalamocortical pathway. Additionally, in an attempt to determine whether there is an intranuclear specificity of projections from individual thalamic nuclei to different subdivisions of the parietal lobe, multiple retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected into the rostral to caudal sectors of the parietal lobe of the same animal. Different subdivisions of the parietal lobe appear to receive different sets of thalamic input. Thus the superior parietal lobule (SPL) projections are derived from more lateral regions in the thalamus, arising predominantly from the lateral posterior (LP) and pulvinar oralis (PO) nuclei, with additional contributions from the pulvinar lateralis (PL) and pulvinar medialis (PM) nuclei. The inferior parietal lobule (IPL), by contrast, receives its projections from more medial thalamic regions, its main thalamic input originating from PM, and aided by LP, PL, and PO. Both the SPL and IPL also receive projections from the mediodorsal (MD), ventroposterior, ventrolateral, intralaminar, and limbic nuclei, albeit from different components within these nuclei. A topographical arrangement also exists in the thalamic projections to the rostral versus the caudal subdivisions of both the SPL and the IPL. Thus, in the SPL, the ventral posterolateral nucleus, pars oralis (VPLo), ventral lateral nucleus, pars oralis (VLo), and ventral lateral nucleus, pars medialis (VLm) project to rostral, whereas the PM and limbic nuclei, anteroventral (AV), and anteromedial (AM), project to area PGm on the medial convexity of the SPL. With respect to projections to the IPL, the ventral posteromedial (VPM) and PO nuclei project to rostral regions, whereas the limbic nuclei lateral dorsal (LD), AM and AV project only to the caudalmost area, Opt. A rostrocaudal difference is reflected also within certain nuclei (LP, PO, and PM) that project to the SPL or IPL. Thus rostral parietal subdivisions receive projections from ventral regions within these thalamic nuclei, whereas caudal parietal afferents arise from the dorsal parts of these nuclei. Intervening cortical levels receive projections from intermediate positions within the nuclei. It therefore seems that the increasing architectonic and functional complexity as one moves from rostral to caudal in the SPL and IPL appear to be reflected in the thalamic afferents. More rostral areas relate to modality-specific thalamic nuclei, whereas more caudal regions concerned with complex functions derive their input from multimodal and limbic nuclei.},

The principal intraparietal corticocortical connections of area 7m in both cebus and macaque cases were with the ipsilateral medial bank of the intraparietal sulcus (MIP) and adjacent superior parietal lobule (area 5), inferior parietal lobule (area 7a), lateral bank of the IPS (area 7ip), caudal parietal operculum (PGop), dorsal bank of the caudal superior temporal sulcus (visual area MST), and medial prestriate cortex (including visual area PO and caudalmedial lobule). Its principal frontal corticocortical connections were with the prefrontal cortex in the shoulder above the principal sulcus and the cortex in the shoulder above the superior ramus of the arcuate sulcus (SAS), the area purported to contain the smooth eye movement-related frontal eye field (FEFsem) in the cebus monkey by other investigators. There were moderate connections with the cortex in the rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus (purported to contain the saccade-related frontal eye field; FEFsac), supplementary eye field (SEF), and rostral dorsal premotor area (PMDr). Area 7m also had major connections with the cingulate cortex (area 23), particularly the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus. The principal subcortical connections of area 7m were with the dorsal portion of the ventrolateral thalamic (VLc) nucleus, lateral posterior thalamic nucleus, lateral pulvinar, caudal mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and medial pulvinar, central lateral, central superior lateral, and central inferior intralaminar thalamic nuclei, dorsolateral caudate nucleus and putamen, middle region of the claustrum, nucleus of the diagonal band, zona incerta, pregeniculate nucleus, anterior and posterior pretectal nuclei, intermediate layer of the superior colliculus, nucleus of Darkschewitsch and dorsomedial parvicellular red nucleus (macaque cases only), dorsal, dorsolateral and lateral basilar pontine nuclei, nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, locus ceruleus, and superior central nucleus. The findings are discussed in terms of the possibility that area 7m contains a “medial parietal eye field” and belongs to a neural network of oculomotor-related structures that plays a role in the control of eye movement.

	abstract = {We have examined the circuitry connecting the posterior parietal cortex with the frontal lobe of rhesus monkeys. HRP-WGA and tritiated amino acids were injected into subdivisions 7m, 7a, 7b, and 7ip of the posterior parietal cortex, and anterograde and retrograde label was recorded within the frontal motor and association cortices. Our main finding is that each subdivision of parietal cortex is connected with a unique set of frontal areas. Thus, area 7m, on the medial parietal surface, is interconnected with the dorsal premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area, including the supplementary eye field. Within the prefrontal cortex, area 7m's connections are with the rostral sector of the frontal eye field (FEF), the dorsal bank of the principal sulcus, and the anterior bank of the inferior arcuate sulcus (Walker's area 45). In contrast, area 7a, on the posterior parietal convexity, is not linked with premotor regions but is heavily interconnected with the rostral FEF in the anterior bank of the superior arcuate sulcus, the dorsolateral prefrontal convexity, the rostral orbitofrontal cortex, area 45, and the fundus and adjacent cortex of the dorsal and ventral banks of the principal sulcus. Area 7b, in the anterior part of the posterior parietal lobule, is interconnected with still a different set of frontal areas, which include the ventral premotor cortex and supplementary motor area, area 45, and the external part of the ventral bank of the principal sulcus. The prominent connections of area 7ip, in the posterior bank of the intraparietal sulcus, are with the supplementary eye field and restricted portions of the ventral premotor cortex, with a wide area of the FEF that includes both its rostral and caudal sectors, and with area 45. All frontoparietal connections are reciprocal, and although they are most prominent within a hemisphere, notable interhemispheric connections are also present. These findings provide a basis for a parcellation of the classically considered association cortex of the frontal lobe, particularly the cortex of the principal sulcus, into sectors defined by their specific connections with the posterior parietal subdivisions. Moreover, the present findings, together with those of a companion study (Cavada and Goldman-Rakic): J. Comp. Neurol. This issue have allowed us to establish multiple linkages between frontal areas and specific limbic and sensory cortices through the posterior parietal cortex. The net-works thus defined may form part of the neural substrate of parallel distrib-uted processing in the cerebral cortex.},

	abstract = {Injections of HRP-WGA in four cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of the posterior parietal cortex in rhesus monkeys allowed us to examine the major limbic and sensory afferent and efferent connections of each area. Area 7a (the caudal part of the posterior parietal lobe) is reciprocally interconnected with multiple visual-related areas: the superior temporal polysensory area (STP) in the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS), visual motion areas in the upper bank of STS, the dorsal prelunate gyrus, and portions of V2 and the parieto-occipital (PO) area. Area 7a is also heavily interconnected with limbic areas: the ventral posterior cingulate cortex, agranular retrosplenial cortex, caudomedial lobule, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the presubiculum. By contrast, the adjacent subdivision, area 7ip (within the posterior bank of the intraparietal sulcus), has few limbic connections but projects to and receives projections from widespread visual areas different than those that are connected with area 7a: the ventral bank and fundus of the STS including part of the STP cortex and the inferotemporal cortex (IT), areas MT (middle temporal) and possibly MTp (MT peripheral) and FST (fundal superior temporal) and portions of V2, V3v, V3d, V3A, V4, PO, and the inferior temporal (IT) convexity cortex. The connections between posterior parietal areas and visual areas located on the medial surface of the occipital and parieto-occipital cortex, containing peripheral representations of the visual field (V2, V3, PO), represent a major previously unrecognized source of visual inputs to the parietal association cortex. Area 7b (the rostral part of the posterior parietal lobe) was distinctive among parietal areas in its selective association with somatosensory-related areas: S1, S2, 5, the vestibular cortex, the insular cortex, and the supplementary somatosensory area (SSA). Like 7ip, area 7b had few limbic associations. Area 7m (on the medial posterior parietal cortex) has its own topographically distinct connections with the limbic (the posterior ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus, granular retrosplenial cortex, and presubiculum), visual (V2, PO, and the visual motion cortex in the upper bank of the STS), and somatosensory (SSA, and area 5) cortical areas. Each parietal subdivision is extensively interconnected with areas of the contralateral hemisphere, including both the homotopic cortex and widespread heterotopic areas. Indeed, each area is interconnected with as many areas of the contralateral hemisphere as it is within the ipsilateral one, though less intensively. This pattern of distribution allows for a remarkable degree of interhemispheric integration. These findings provide evidence that each major subdivision of posteriorparietal cortex has a unique set of reciprocal connections with limbic and sen-sory areas in both hemispheres. For the most part, each parietalsubdivision, rather than being a site of multimodal convergence, receives input from only one sensory modality, though often from different channels of information within that modality. For example, the two streams of visual information tra-ditionally linked to pattern and motion seem to converge in both areas 7a and 7ip. The areal parcellation of parietal cortex byits afferent and efferent con-nections provides an anatomical foundation for a parallel processing model of higher cortical functions.},

The present study compared the ipsilateral thalamic-cortical connections with the corresponding crossed, contralateral connections between these same sets of regions. All efferents from the anteromedial thalamic nucleus to the cortex, as well as those to the subiculum, remained ipsilateral. In contrast, all of these target sites provided reciprocal, bilateral projections to the anteromedial nucleus. While the anteroventral thalamic nucleus often shared this same asymmetric pattern of cortical connections, it received relatively fewer crossed inputs than the anteromedial nucleus. This difference was most marked for the anterior cingulate projections, as those to the anteroventral nucleus remained almost entirely ipsilateral. Unlike the anteromedial nucleus, the anteroventral nucleus also appeared to provide a restricted, crossed projection to the contralateral retrosplenial cortex. Meanwhile, the closely related laterodorsal thalamic nucleus had almost exclusively ipsilateral efferent and afferent cortical connections. Likewise, within the hippocampus, the postsubiculum seemingly had only ipsilateral efferent and afferent connections with the anterior thalamic and laterodorsal nuclei. While the bilateral cortical projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei originated predominantly from layer VI, the accompanying sparse projections from layer V largely gave rise to ipsilateral thalamic inputs. In testing a potentially unifying principle of anterior thalamic – cortical interactions, a slightly more individual pattern emerged that reinforces other evidence of functional differences within the anterior thalamic and also helps to explain the consequences of unilateral interventions involving these nuclei.},

As the original Papez circuit failed to explain functional imaging findings, a more detailed investigation is needed to delineate connections among the circuit’s key hubs. Here we acquired diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) from eight normal subjects and used data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to elucidate connections among hubs in the retrosplenial gyrus, hippocampus, mammillary bodies, and anterior thalamic nuclei. Our results show that the ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC) was visualized in all eight individual DSI datasets, as well as in the DSI and HCP group datasets, but a strictly defined VHC was only visualized in one individual dataset. Thalamic fibers were observed to connect with both the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The RSC was mainly responsible for direct hippocampal connections, while the PCC was not. This indicates that the RSC and PCC represent separate functional hubs in humans, as also shown by previous primate axonal tracing studies and functional magnetic resonance imaging observations.},

	abstract = {This review brings together current knowledge from tract tracing studies to update and reconsider those limbic connections initially highlighted by Papez for their presumed role in emotion. These connections link hippocampal and parahippocampal regions with the mammillary bodies, the anterior thalamic nuclei, and the cingulate gyrus, all structures now strongly implicated in memory functions. An additional goal of this review is to describe the routes taken by the various connections within this network. The original descriptions of these limbic connections saw their interconnecting pathways forming a serial circuit that began and finished in the hippocampal formation. It is now clear that with the exception of the mammillary bodies, these various sites are multiply interconnected with each other, including many reciprocal connections. In addition, these same connections are topographically organised, creating further subsystems. This complex pattern of connectivity helps explain the difficulty of interpreting the functional outcome of damage to any individual site within the network. For these same reasons, Papez’s initial concept of a loop beginning and ending in the hippocampal formation needs to be seen as a much more complex system of hippocampal–diencephalic–cingulate connections. The functions of these multiple interactions might be better viewed as principally providing efferent information from the posterior medial temporal lobe. Both a subcortical diencephalic route (via the fornix) and a cortical cingulate route (via retrosplenial cortex) can be distinguished. These routes provide indirect pathways for hippocampal interactions with prefrontal cortex, with the preponderance of both sets of connections arising from the more posterior hippocampal regions. These multi-stage connections complement the direct hippocampal projections to prefrontal cortex, which principally arise from the anterior hippocampus, thereby creating longitudinal functional differences along the anterior–posterior plane of the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {This is the first in a series of reports on the neuroanatomic organization and connectivity of the macaque monkey retrosplenial cortex, i.e., areas 29 and 30. To elucidate the topographic configuration of the retrosplenial cortex and adjacent structures, we have made three-dimensional computer reconstructions of the posterior cingulate region that includes the retrosplenial cortex. The largest portion of the posterior cingulate gyrus is located dorsal to the corpus callosum. At the caudal limit of the corpus callosum, the gyrus curves around the splenium, turns laterally and forms a region called the isthmus that links the cingulate and parahippocampal gyri. The isthmus contains the caudomedial lobule, which is a rostrally oriented bulge that is made up, in part, of portions of the retrosplenial cortex. To delineate the subdivisions of the retrosplenial and adjacent cortices, we conducted a cytoarchitectonic analysis by using cerebral hemispheres that were cut at oblique angles and stained with a variety of techniques, including immunohistochemistry for nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein. The dorsal bank of the callosal sulcus and the rostral surface of the isthmus are covered by the retrosplenial cortical areas 29l, 29m, and 30, whereas most of the medial surface of the posterior cingulate gyrus and the ventral bank of the posterior cingulate sulcus consist of areas 23i and 23e. The most caudoventral portion of the cingulate gyrus is composed of an area (area 23v) that resembles the retrosplenial and posterior cingulate cortices but has a much more prominent layer IV. On the dorsal bank of the calcarine sulcus, we also defined a transitional zone, area 30v, located between the retrosplenial cortex and the prestriate visual cortex. J. Comp.

	abstract = {We investigated the cortical afferents of the retrosplenial cortex and the adjacent posterior cingulate cortex (area 23) in the macaque monkey by using the retrograde tracers Fast blue and Diamidino yellow. We quantitatively analyzed the distribution of labeled neurons throughout the cortical mantle. Injections involving the retrosplenial cortex resulted in labeled neurons within the retrosplenial cortex and in areas 23 and 31 (∼78\% of the total labeled cells). In the remainder of the cortex, the heaviest projections originated in the hippocampal formation, including the entorhinal cortex, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. The parahippocampal and perirhinal cortices also contained many labeled neurons, as did the prefrontal cortex, mainly in areas 46, 9, 10, and 11, and the occipital cortex, mainly area V2. Injections in area 23 also resulted in numerous labeled cells in the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial regions (∼67\% of total labeled cells). As in the retrosplenial cortex, injections of area 23 led to many labeled neurons in the frontal cortex, although most of these cells were in areas 9 and 46. Larger numbers of retrogradely labeled cells were also distributed more widely in the posterior parietal cortex, including areas 7a, 7m, LIP, and DP. There were some labeled cells in the parahippocampal cortex. These connections are consistent with the retrosplenial cortex acting as an interface between the working memory functions in the prefrontal areas and the long-term memory encoding in the medial temporal lobe. The posterior cingulate cortex, in contrast, may be more highly associated with visuospatial functions. J. Comp. Neurol. 466:48–79, 2003. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the cortical efferent projections of the macaque monkey retrosplenial and posterior cingulate cortices by using 3H-amino acids as anterograde tracers. All the injections produced extensive local connections to other portions of this region. There were also a number of extrinsic efferent cortical connections, many of which have not hitherto been reported. Major projections from the retrosplenial cortex were directed to the frontal lobe, with heaviest terminations in areas 46, 9, 10, and 11. There were also very substantial projections to the entorhinal cortex, presubiculum, and parasubiculum of the hippocampal formation, as well as to areas TH and TF of the parahippocampal cortex. Some injections led to labeling of area V4, the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus, and area 7a of the parietal cortex. Projections from the posterior cingulate cortex innervated all these same regions, although the density of termination was different from the retrosplenial projections. The posterior cingulate cortex gave rise to additional projections to parietal area DP and to the cortex along the convexity of the superior temporal gyrus. The ventral portion of the posterior cingulate cortex (area 23v) gave rise to much denser efferent projections to the hippocampal formation than the dorsal portions (areas 23e and i). These connections are discussed in relation to the clinical syndromes of retrosplenial amnesia and topographic disorientation in humans commonly caused by lesions in the caudoventral portions of the retrosplenial and posterior cingulate cortices.

	abstract = {A central feature of theories of spatial navigation involves the representation of spatial relationships between objects in complex environments. The parietal cortex has long been linked to the processing of spatial visual information and recent evidence from single unit recording in rodents suggests a role for this region in encoding egocentric and world-centered frames. The rat parietal cortex can be subdivided into up to four distinct rostral-caudal and medial-lateral regions, which includes a zone previously characterized as secondary visual cortex. At present, very little is known regarding the relative connectivity of these parietal subdivisions. Thus, we set out to map the connectivity of the entire anterior-posterior and medial-lateral span of this region. To do this we used anterograde and retrograde tracers in conjunction with open source neuronal segmentation and tracer detection tools to generate whole brain connectivity maps of parietal inputs and outputs. Our present results show that inputs to the parietal cortex varied significantly along the medial-lateral, but not the rostral-caudal axis. Specifically, retrosplenial connectivity is greater medially, but connectivity with visual cortex, though generally sparse, is more significant laterally. Finally, based on connection density, the connectivity between parietal cortex and hippocampus is indirect and likely achieved largely via dysgranular retrosplenial cortex. Thus, similar to primates, the parietal cortex of rats exhibits a difference in connectivity along the medial-lateral axis, which may represent functionally distinct areas.},

	abstract = {It is surprising how quickly we can find our bearings when suddenly confronted with a familiar environment, for instance when the lights are turned on in a dark room. Subjectively, this appears to occur almost instantaneously, yet the neural processes permitting this rapid reorientation are unknown. A likely candidate is the head direction (HD) cell system. These limbic neurons found in several brain regions, including the thalamus and the hippocampus, discharge selectively when the head of an animal is oriented in a particular (“preferred”) direction. This neuronal activity is independent of position and ongoing behavior and is thus likely to constitute a physiological basis for the sense of direction. Remarkably, although the HD cell system has properties resembling those of a compass, it is independent of geomagnetic fields. Rather, the preferred directions of the HD cells are strongly anchored to visual cues in the environment. Here, we bring evidence for the first time that a fundamental component of the capacity to rapidly reorient in a familiar environment may be brought about by updating of HD cell responses as rapidly as 80 msec after changes in the visual scene. Continuous attractor networks have been used successfully to model HD cell ensemble dynamics. The present results suggest that after large rotations of the surrounding landmarks, activity in such networks may be propagated in abrupt jumps rather than in a gradually progressive manner.},

	abstract = {Place cells of the hippocampal formation encode a spatial representation of the environment, and the orientation of this representation is apparently governed by the head direction cell system. The representation of a well-explored environment by CA1 place cells can be split when there is conflicting information from salient proximal and distal cues, as some place fields rotate to follow the distal cues while others rotate to follow the proximal cues (). In contrast, the CA3 representation is more coherent than CA1, as the place fields in CA3 tend to rotate in the same direction (). The present study tests whether the head direction cell network produces a split representation or remains coherent under these conditions, by simultaneously recording both CA1 place cell and head direction cells from the thalamus. In agreement with earlier studies, split representations of the environment were observed in ensembles of CA1 place cells in about 75\% of the mismatch sessions, in which some fields followed the counterclockwise rotation of proximal cues and other fields followed the clockwise rotation of distal cues. However, out of 225 recording sessions, there was not a single instance of the head direction cell ensembles revealing a split representation of head direction. Instead, in most of the mismatch sessions the head direction cell tuning curves rotated as an ensemble clockwise (94\%) and in a few sessions rotated counterclockwise (6\%). The findings support the notion that the head direction cells may be part of an attractor network bound more strongly to distal landmarks than proximal landmarks, even under conditions in which the CA1 place representation loses its coherence.},

To assess the contribution of these cells in spatial learning, Long-Evans rats were tested in a variety of spatial and nonspatial tasks following bilateral electrolytic or neurotoxic lesions of the postsubiculum. Compared to unlesioned control animals, lesioned animals were impaired on two spatial tasks, a radial eight-arm maze task and a Morris water task, although the performance scores of both lesion groups improved over the course of behavioral testing. In contrast, lesioned animals were unimpaired on two nonspatial tasks, a cued version of the water maze task and a conditioned taste-aversion paradigm. In addition, lesioned animals showed transient hyperactivity in an open-field activity test. These results support the concept that neurons in the postsubiculum are part of a neural network involved in the processing of spatial information.},

	abstract = {The limbic thalamus, specifically the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN), contains brain signals including that of head direction cells, which fire as a function of an animal's directional orientation in an environment. Recent work has suggested that this directional orientation information stemming from the ATN contributes to the generation of hippocampal and parahippocampal spatial representations, and may contribute to the establishment of unique spatial representations in radially oriented tasks such as the radial arm maze. While previous studies have shown that ATN lesions can impair spatial working memory performance in the radial maze, little work has been done to investigate spatial reference memory in a discrimination task variant. Further, while previous studies have shown that ATN lesions can impair performance in the radial maze, these studies produced the ATN lesions prior to training. It is therefore unclear whether the ATN lesions disrupted acquisition or retention of radial maze performance. Here, we tested the role of ATN signaling in a previously learned spatial discrimination task on a radial arm maze. Rats were first trained to asymptotic levels in a task in which two maze arms were consistently baited across training. After 24 h, animals received muscimol inactivation of the ATN before a 4 trial probe test. We report impairments in post-inactivation trials, suggesting that signals from the ATN modulate the use of a previously acquired spatial discrimination in the radial-arm maze. The results are discussed in relation to the thalamo-cortical limbic circuits involved in spatial information processing, with an emphasis on the head direction signal.},

One way to estimate head-direction is by integrating head angular-velocity over time. However, this process results in error accumulation resembling a random walk, proportional to , which constitutes a mark for a path integration process. In the present study we analyzed previously recorded data to quantify the drift in head-direction cells of rat pups before and after eye-opening. We found that in rat pups before eye-opening the drift propagated as a random walk, while in rats after eye-opening the drift was lower. This suggests that a path-integration process underlies the estimation of head-direction, such that before eye-opening the head-direction system runs in an open-loop manner and accumulates error. After eye-opening, visual-input, such as arena shape, helps to correct errors and thus compute the sense of direction accurately.},

	abstract = {As far back as the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, microbial infections were responsible for vast numbers of deaths. The trend reversed with the introduction of antibiotics coinciding with longer life. Increased life expectancy however, accompanied the emergence of age related chronic inflammatory states including the sporadic form of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Taken together, the true challenge of retaining health into later years of life now appears to lie in delaying and/or preventing the progression of chronic inflammatory diseases, through identifying and influencing modifiable risk factors. Diverse pathogens, including periodontal bacteria have been associated with AD brains. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) hallmark protein of AD may be a consequence of infection, called upon due to its antimicrobial properties. Up to this moment in time, a lack of understanding and knowledge of a microbiome associated with AD brain has ensured that the role pathogens may play in this neurodegenerative disease remains unrequited. The oral microbiome embraces a range of diverse bacterial phylotypes, which especially in vulnerable individuals, will excite and perpetuate a range of inflammatory conditions, to a wide range of extra-oral body tissues and organs specific to their developing pathophysiology, including the brain. This offers the tantalizing opportunity that by controlling the oral-specific microbiome; clinicians may treat or prevent a range of chronic inflammatory diseases orally. Evolution has equipped the human host to combat infection/disease by providing an immune system, but Porphyromonas gingivalis and selective spirochetes, have developed immune avoidance strategies threatening the host-microbe homeostasis. It is clear from longitudinal monitoring of patients that chronic periodontitis contributes to declining cognition. The aim here is to discuss the contribution from opportunistic pathogens of the periodontal microbiome, and highlight the challenges, the host faces, when dealing with unresolvable oral infections that may lead to clinical manifestations that are characteristic for AD.},

Towards this end, we characterized the bacterial taxonomic composition of fecal samples from participants with and without a diagnosis of dementia due to AD. Our analyses revealed that the gut microbiome of AD participants has decreased microbial diversity and is compositionally distinct from control age- and sex-matched individuals. We identified phylum- through genus-wide differences in bacterial abundance including decreased Firmicutes, increased Bacteroidetes, and decreased Bifidobacterium in the microbiome of AD participants. Furthermore, we observed correlations between levels of differentially abundant genera and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD. These findings add AD to the growing list of diseases associated with gut microbial alterations, as well as suggest that gut bacterial communities may be a target for therapeutic intervention.},

The discovery of several genes responsible for the familial forms has led to a better comprehension of the molecular pathways involved in the selective neuronal degeneration which is specific for each of these disorders. However, the vast majority of the cases occurs as sporadic forms, likely resulting from complex gene–gene and gene–environment interplay. Several environmental factors, including, pesticides, metals, head injuries, lifestyles and dietary habits have been associated with increased disease risk or even with protection. Hundreds of genetic variants have been investigated as possible risk factors for the sporadic forms, but results are often conflicting, not repeated or inconclusive. New approaches to environmental health research are revealing us that at the basis there could be chemically induced changes in gene regulation and emphasise the importance of understanding the susceptibility of the human epigenome to dietary and other environmental effects.},

Each wave followed a 2-stage design, with an in-home screening interview followed by a full diagnostic workup of a subsample of participants based on screening performance.Setting and ParticipantsA total of 2459 community-dwelling Yoruba residents of Ibadan, Nigeria, without dementia, and 2147 community-dwelling African American residents of Indianapolis, Ind, without dementia (all aged 65 years or older). The cohorts were followed up for a mean of 5.1 years and 4.7 years, respectively.Main Outcome MeasuresIncident cases of dementia and AD in each of the 2 populations.ResultsThe age-standardized annual incidence rates were significantly lower among Yoruba than among African Americans for dementia (Yoruba, 1.35\% [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 1.13\%-1.56\%]; African Americans, 3.24\% [95\% CI, 2.11\%-4.38\%]) and for AD (Yoruba, 1.15\% [95\% CI, 0.96\%-1.35\%]; African Americans, 2.52\% [95\% CI, 1.40\%-3.64\%]).ConclusionThis is the first report of incidence rate differences for dementia and AD in studies of 2 populations from nonindustrialized and industrialized countries using identical methods and the same group of investigators in both sites.

	abstract = {Prior work suggests that amyloid precursor protein (APP) can function as a proinflammatory receptor on immune cells, such as monocytes and microglia. Therefore, we hypothesized that APP serves this function in microglia during Alzheimer's disease. Although fibrillar amyloid β (Aβ)-stimulated cytokine secretion from both wild-type and APP knock-out (mAPP−/−) microglial cultures, oligomeric Aβ was unable to stimulate increased secretion from mAPP−/− cells. This was consistent with an ability of oligomeric Aβ to bind APP. Similarly, intracerebroventricular infusions of oligomeric Aβ produced less microgliosis in mAPP−/− mice compared with wild-type mice. The mAPP−/− mice crossed to an APP/PS1 transgenic mouse line demonstrated reduced microgliosis and cytokine levels and improved memory compared with wild-type mice despite robust fibrillar Aβ plaque deposition. These data define a novel function for microglial APP in regulating their ability to acquire a proinflammatory phenotype during disease.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains is the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide within plaques robustly invested with reactive microglia. This supports the notion that Aβ stimulation of microglial activation is one source of brain inflammatory changes during disease. Aβ is a cleavage product of the ubiquitously expressed amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is able to self-associate into a wide variety of differently sized and structurally distinct multimers. In this study, we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that nonfibrillar, oligomeric forms of Aβ are able to interact with the parent APP protein to stimulate microglial activation. This provides a mechanism by which metabolism of APP results in possible autocrine or paracrine Aβ production to drive the microgliosis associated with AD brains.},

The review considers laboratory and animal studies that identify underlying mechanisms as well as prospective epidemiologic studies linking biochemical or dietary fatty acids to cognitive decline or incident dementia. Several lines of evidence provide support for the hypothesis that high saturated or trans fatty acids increase the risk of dementia and high polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fatty acids decrease risk. Dietary fat composition is an important factor in blood-brain barrier function and the blood cholesterol profile. Cholesterol and blood-brain barrier function are involved in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease, and the primary genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, apolipoprotein E-ε4, is involved in cholesterol transport. The epidemiologic literature is seemingly inconsistent on this topic, but many studies are difficult to interpret because of analytical techniques that ignored negative confounding by other fatty acids, which likely resulted in null findings. The studies that appropriately adjust for confounding by other fats support the dietary fat composition hypothesis.},

Increased tumor necrosis factor α production and induction of neuronal injury occurred when Aβ-stimulated microglia were treated with CD40 ligand (CD40L). Microglia from Tg APPsw mice deficient for CD40L demonstrated reduction in activation, suggesting that the CD40-CD40L interaction is necessary for Aβ-induced microglial activation.

	abstract = {The genetic determinants of the human innate immune response are poorly understood. Apolipoprotein (Apo) E, a lipid-trafficking protein that affects inflammation, has well-described wild-type (ε3) and disease-associated (ε2 and ε4) alleles, but its connection to human innate immunity is undefined. We sought to define the relationship of APOε4 to the human innate immune response. We evaluated APOε4 in several functional models of the human innate immune response, including intravenous LPS challenge in human subjects, and assessed APOε4 association to organ injury in patients with severe sepsis, a disease driven by dysregulated innate immunity. Whole blood from healthy APOε3/APOε4 volunteers induced higher cytokine levels on ex vivo stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4, or TLR5 ligands than blood from APOε3/APOε3 patients, whereas TLR7/8 responses were similar. This was associated with increased lipid rafts in APOε3/APOε4 monocytes. By contrast, APOε3/APOε3 and APOε3/APOε4 serum neutralized LPS equivalently and supported similar LPS responses in Apoe-deficient macrophages, arguing against a differential role for secretory APOE4 protein. After intravenous LPS, APOε3/APOε4 patients had higher hyperthermia and plasma TNF-α levels and earlier plasma IL-6 than APOε3/APOε3 patients. APOE4-targeted replacement mice displayed enhanced hypothermia, plasma cytokines, and hepatic injury and altered splenic lymphocyte apoptosis after systemic LPS compared with APOE3 counterparts. In a cohort of 828 patients with severe sepsis, APOε4 was associated with increased coagulation system failure among European American patients. APOε4 is a determinant of the human innate immune response to multiple TLR ligands and associates with altered patterns of organ injury in human sepsis.},

Post-menopausal women with AD who express at least one APOE4 gene have more severe neuropathology and worsened cognitive scores than their non-expressing counterparts. Since 17β-estradiol down-regulates inflammation as part of its neuroprotective role, we examined the effect of 17β-estradiol on the response of microglia to immune activation as a function of APOE genotype. Our data show that the anti-inflammatory activity of 17β-estradiol is significantly reduced in APOE4 targeted replacement mice compared to APOE3 mice. A significant interaction between APOE genotype and the response to 17β-estradiol was observed for NO and cytokine production by immune activated microglia. The genotype specific effect was not restricted to brain macrophages since peritoneal macrophages from APOE4 ovariectomized mice also demonstrated a significant difference in 17β-estradiol responsiveness. ERβ protein levels in APOE4 microglia were higher than APOE3 microglia, suggesting a difference in post-translational protein regulation in the presence of the APOE4 gene. Overall, our data indicate that the APOE genotype may be a critical component in assessing the effectiveness of 17β-estradiol's action and may impact the neuroprotective role of 17β-estradiol and of hormone replacement therapy on brain function when the APOE4 gene is expressed.},

	abstract = {Apolipoprotein-E protein is an endogenous immunomodulatory agent that affects both the innate and the adaptive immune responses. Since individuals with the APOE4 gene demonstrate worsened pathology and poorer outcomes in many neurological disorders, we examined isoform-specific differences in the response of microglia, the primary cellular component of the brain's innate immune response, in detail. Our data demonstrate that microglia derived from APOE4/4 targeted replacement mice demonstrate a pro-inflammatory phenotype that includes altered cell morphology, increased NO production associated with increased NOS2 mRNA levels, and higher pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNFα, IL-6, IL12p40) compared to microglia derived from APOE3/3 targeted replacement mice. The effect is gene dose-dependent and increases with the number of APOE4 gene alleles. The APOE genotype-specific immune profile observed in the microglial immune response is also observed in the cortex of aged APOE3/3 and APOE4/4 mice treated with lipopolysacchride (LPS) and in peripheral (peritoneal) macrophages. To determine if APOE4's action resulted from an isoform-specific difference in effective levels of the apolipoproteins, we generated mice expressing only a single allele of APOE3. Immune-stimulated macrophages from APOE3/0 mice demonstrated an increased inflammatory response compared to APOE3/3 mice, but less than in APOE4/4 mice. These data suggest that inhibition of inflammation depends upon the dose of apoE3 protein available and that apoE4 protein may alter inflammation partly by dose effects and partly by being qualitatively different than apoE3. Overall, these data emphasize the important role of apolipoprotein E and of the APOE genotype on the immune responses that are evident in most, if not all, neurological disease.},

	abstract = {The physiological consequences of acute and chronic stress on a range of organ systems have been well documented after the pioneering work of Hans Selye more than 70 years ago. More recently, an association between exposure to stressful life events and the development of later-life cognitive dysfunction has been proposed. Several plausible neurohormonal pathways and genetic mechanisms exist to support such an association. However, many logistical and methodological barriers must be overcome before a defined causal linkage can be firmly established. Here the authors review recent studies of the long-term cognitive consequences of exposures to cumulative ordinary life stressors as well as extraordinary traumatic events leading to posttraumatic stress disorder. Suggestive effects have been demonstrated for the role of life stress in general, and posttraumatic stress disorder in particular, on a range of negative cognitive outcomes, including worse than normal changes with aging, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. However, given the magnitude of the issue, well-controlled studies are relatively few in number, and the effects they have revealed are modest in size. Moreover, the effects have typically only been demonstrated on a selective subset of measures and outcomes. Potentially confounding factors abound and complicate causal relationships despite efforts to contain them. More well-controlled, carefully executed longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the apparent association between stress and dementia, clarify causal relationships, develop reliable antemortem markers, and delineate distinct patterns of risk in subsets of individuals.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the relation between head trauma and incidence of dementia in a prospective population-based study.
Background: Whether head trauma increases the risk of dementia and AD remains controversial. It has been suggested that the risk might be particularly increased for carriers of the APOE-ε4 allele.
Methods: The study population included 6645 participants of the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study, aged 55 years or older, who were free of dementia at baseline. Head trauma with loss of consciousness was measured at baseline by a self-report to a physician and detailed the number of head traumas, time since head trauma, and duration of loss of consciousness. The cohort was followed for incident dementia that was diagnosed according to international criteria. Logistic regression was used to calculate the risk of dementia after adjusting for age, gender, and education.
Results: No increased risk of dementia or AD was found for persons with a history of head trauma with loss of consciousness (relative risk [RR] for dementia = 1.0, 95\% CI, 0.5–2.0; RR for AD = 0.8, 95\% CI, 0.4–1.9). Multiple head traumas, time since head trauma, and duration of unconsciousness did not significantly influence the risk of dementia. In addition, the APOE-ε4 allele did not modify the relationship.
Conclusions: This study suggests that mild head trauma is not a major risk factor for dementia or AD in the elderly. In addition, this study does not concur with previous cross-sectional studies suggesting an interaction with the APOE genotype.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common in military personnel, and there is growing concern about the long-term effects of TBI on the brain; however, few studies have examined the association between TBI and risk of dementia in veterans.
Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 188,764 US veterans aged 55 years or older who had at least one inpatient or outpatient visit during both the baseline (2000–2003) and follow-up (2003–2012) periods and did not have a dementia diagnosis at baseline. TBI and dementia diagnoses were determined using ICD-9 codes in electronic medical records. Fine-Gray proportional hazards models were used to determine whether TBI was associated with greater risk of incident dementia, accounting for the competing risk of death and adjusting for demographics, medical comorbidities, and psychiatric disorders.
Results: Veterans were a mean age of 68 years at baseline. During the 9-year follow-up period, 16\% of those with TBI developed dementia compared with 10\% of those without TBI (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.57; 95\% confidence interval: 1.35–1.83). There was evidence of an additive association between TBI and other conditions on risk of dementia.
Conclusions: TBI in older veterans was associated with a 60\% increase in the risk of developing dementia over 9 years after accounting for competing risks and potential confounders. Our results suggest that TBI in older veterans may predispose toward development of symptomatic dementia and raise concern about the potential long-term consequences of TBI in younger veterans and civilians.},

Considering the increase in the prevalence of both traumatic brain injury and AD in recent times, the possibility that brain trauma may provoke the early development of AD has important implications for health service planning, preventative efforts, and medico-legal compensation settlements. This paper evaluates the plausibility of the proposed link between traumatic brain injury and AD, largely by way of exploring a theoretical perspective advanced by Satz (1993) and considering recent contributions from the epidemiological, neuropathological, and biochemical literature that are pertinent to this issue. The literature reviewed provides sufficient support and empirical vindication to give credence to the proposed association between these two neuropsychological entities at the statistical, theoretical, and biological level.},

Plasma FA, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and lipid concentrations were determined at baseline and following a 12-week randomized, controlled, parallel, dietary FA intervention in 442 adults with MetS (LIPGENE study). FA-APOE gene interactions at baseline and following change in plasma FA were assessed using adjusted general linear models. At baseline E4 carriers had higher plasma concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apo B) compared with E2 carriers; and higher TC, LDL-C and apo B compared with E3/E3. Whilst elevated plasma n-3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) was associated with a beneficially lower concentration of apo CIII in E2 carriers, a high proportion of plasma C16:0 was associated with insulin resistance in E4 carriers. Following FA intervention, a reduction in plasma long-chain n-3 PUFA was associated with a reduction in apo CII concentration in E2 carriers. Our novel data suggest that individuals with MetS may benefit from personalized dietary interventions based on APOE genotype.},

However, major gaps exist in our knowledge with regard to nutritional adequacy, nutrient-disease interactions, nutrient-gene interactions, and effective strategies for implementation of dietary recommendations which have the potential to decrease the disease burden and to contribute to successful aging of the population. Coronary heart disease is one of the major causes of mortality in the world. We have sound evidence that high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Lipoprotein concentrations are associated with environmental variables such as diet and lifestyle, but genetics also play a significant role. We have examined polymorphisms at candidate loci to determine their usefulness as markers for dietary responses. A G/A polymorphism 75 bp upstream from the gene encoding apolipoprotein AI (APOA1) has been described in approximately 30\% of the population. Our studies show that this polymorphism is associated with variability in the HDL-C response to dietary fat, specifically to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the diet. Carriers of the A allele respond to increases in dietary PUFA with elevations in HDL-C levels, probably due to altered interactions of transcription factors with the mutated promoter. Therefore carriers of the A allele can potentially decrease their atherogenic risk by consuming high-PUFA diets. Likewise, we have examined the interaction between other dietary habits, such as alcohol drinking, and variability at the APOE locus, and have demonstrated that the classical associations between APOE polymorphism and LDL-C levels are observed primarily in those subjects who consume alcohol. Moreover, we have found a subgroup of the population, APOE4 carriers, for whom drinking alcohol may exert detrimental effects on lipid metabolism. This knowledge will contribute towards the development of more effective personalized dietary recommendations.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder caused by fully penetrant single gene mutations in a minority of cases, while the majority of cases are sporadic or show modest familial clustering. These cases are of late onset and likely result from the interaction of many genes and the environment. More than 30 loci have been implicated in AD by a combination of linkage, genome-wide association, and whole genome/exome sequencing. We have learned from these studies that perturbations in endolysosomal, lipid metabolism, and immune response pathways substantially contribute to sporadic AD pathogenesis. We review here current knowledge about functions of AD susceptibility genes, highlighting cells of the myeloid lineage as drivers of at least part of the genetic component in late-onset AD. Although targeted resequencing utilized for the identification of causal variants has discovered coding mutations in some AD-associated genes, a lot of risk variants lie in noncoding regions. Here we discuss the use of functional genomics approaches that integrate transcriptomic, epigenetic, and endophenotype traits with systems biology to annotate genetic variants, and to facilitate discovery of AD risk genes. Further validation in cell culture and mouse models will be necessary to establish causality for these genes. This knowledge will allow mechanism-based design of novel therapeutic interventions in AD and promises coherent implementation of treatment in a personalized manner.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Alzheimer disease (AD) represents a major and increasing public health problem. If populations were identified with significantly lower or higher incidence rates of AD, the search for risk factors in the genesis of AD could be greatly enhanced.
OBJECTIVE: To compare incidence rates of dementia and AD in 2 diverse, elderly community-dwelling populations.
DESIGN: The Indianapolis-Ibadan Dementia Project, a longitudinal, prospective population-based study consisting of a baseline survey (1992-1993) and 2 subsequent follow-up waves after 2 years (1994-1995) and 5 years (1997-1998). Each wave followed a 2-stage design, with an in-home screening interview followed by a full diagnostic workup of a subsample of participants based on screening performance.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2459 community-dwelling Yoruba residents of Ibadan, Nigeria, without dementia, and 2147 community-dwelling African American residents of Indianapolis, Ind, without dementia (all aged 65 years or older). The cohorts were followed up for a mean of 5.1 years and 4.7 years, respectively.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident cases of dementia and AD in each of the 2 populations.
RESULTS: The age-standardized annual incidence rates were significantly lower among Yoruba than among African Americans for dementia (Yoruba, 1.35\% [95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.13\%-1.56\%]; African Americans, 3.24\% [95\% CI, 2.11\%-4.38\%]) and for AD (Yoruba, 1.15\% [95\% CI, 0.96\%-1.35\%]; African Americans, 2.52\% [95\% CI, 1.40\%-3.64\%]).
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of incidence rate differences for dementia and AD in studies of 2 populations from nonindustrialized and industrialized countries using identical methods and the same group of investigators in both sites. Further explorations of these population differences may identify potentially modifiable environmental or genetic factors to account for site differences in dementia and AD.},

Of these, an estimated 318 656 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI], 306 064-329 755; 45.4\%) cardiometabolic deaths per year were associated with suboptimal intakes—48.6\% (95\% UI, 46.2\%-50.9\%) of cardiometabolic deaths in men and 41.8\% (95\% UI, 39.3\%-44.2\%) in women; 64.2\% (95\% UI, 60.6\%-67.9\%) at younger ages (25-34 years) and 35.7\% (95\% UI, 33.1\%-38.1\%) at older ages (≥75 years); 53.1\% (95\% UI, 51.6\%-54.8\%) among blacks, 50.0\% (95\% UI, 48.2\%-51.8\%) among Hispanics, and 42.8\% (95\% UI, 40.9\%-44.5\%) among whites; and 46.8\% (95\% UI, 44.9\%-48.7\%) among lower-, 45.7\% (95\% UI, 44.2\%-47.4\%) among medium-, and 39.1\% (95\% UI, 37.2\%-41.2\%) among higher-educated individuals. The largest numbers of estimated diet-related cardiometabolic deaths were related to high sodium (66 508 deaths in 2012; 9.5\% of all cardiometabolic deaths), low nuts/seeds (59 374; 8.5\%), high processed meats (57 766; 8.2\%), low seafood omega-3 fats (54 626; 7.8\%), low vegetables (53 410; 7.6\%), low fruits (52 547; 7.5\%), and high SSBs (51 694; 7.4\%). Between 2002 and 2012, population-adjusted US cardiometabolic deaths per year decreased by 26.5\%. The greatest decline was associated with insufficient polyunsaturated fats (−20.8\% relative change [95\% UI, −18.5\% to −22.8\%]), nuts/seeds (−18.0\% [95\% UI, −14.6\% to −21.0\%]), and excess SSBs (−14.5\% [95\% UI, −12.0\% to −16.9\%]).

Mississippi had the highest rates of obesity (24.3\%) and of diabetes (8.8\%); Colorado had the lowest rate of obesity (13.8\%); and Alaska had the lowest rate of diabetes (4.4\%). Twenty-seven percent of US adults did not engage in any physical activity, and another 28.2\% were not regularly active. Only 24.4\% of US adults consumed fruits and vegetables 5 or more times daily. Among obese participants who had had a routine checkup during the past year, 42.8\% had been advised by a health care professional to lose weight. Among participants trying to lose or maintain weight, 17.5\% were following recommendations to eat fewer calories and increase physical activity to more than 150 min/wk.ConclusionsThe prevalence of obesity and diabetes continues to increase among US adults. Interventions are needed to improve physical activity and diet in communities nationwide.},

It represents the most prevalent cause of dementia in our society and its incidence rates exponentially increase with age. Currently, this disorder does not have any cure and it is essential to know all the variables and factors involved in the development of this disorder. Among these factors, there are different categories such as biological and environmental aspects. It seems that the immune system (IS) and the stress system are some of them and the knowledge about their role in this disorder is an important question in this area. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that both systems are related and this relationship can also be influenced by the emotional system. In fact, the levels of the IS biomarker (immunoglobulin A) and the stress system (cortisol) are different in people with and without AD and IgA is higher in patients with high wellbeing. Therefore, the new therapies in AD should be focused on the influence of these systems and on postulating new alternative perspectives like non-pharmacological therapies. All this is essential for the study of AD in order to improve the quality of life in these patients, as well as knowing all the variables involved, so as to generate new therapeutic targets in AD.},

	abstract = {We previously demonstrated that transplantation of murine neural stem cells (NSCs) can improve motor and cognitive function in a transgenic model of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). These benefits occurred without changes in human α-synuclein pathology and were mediated in part by stem cell-induced elevation of brain–derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, instrastriatal NSC transplantation likely alters the brain microenvironment via multiple mechanisms that may synergize to promote cognitive and motor recovery. The underlying neurobiology that mediates such restoration no doubt involves numerous genes acting in concert to modulate signaling within and between host brain cells and transplanted NSCs. In order to identify functionally connected gene networks and additional mechanisms that may contribute to stem cell-induced benefits, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on striatal tissue isolated from NSC- and vehicle-injected wild-type and DLB mice. Combining continuous behavioral and biochemical data with genome wide expression via network analysis proved to be a powerful approach; revealing significant alterations in immune response, neurotransmission, and mitochondria function. Taken together, these data shed further light on the gene network and biological processes that underlie the therapeutic effects of NSC transplantation on α-synuclein induced cognitive and motor impairments, thereby highlighting additional therapeutic targets for synucleinopathies.},

We summarize effects of the microbiota on host neurophysiology, including brain microstructure, gene expression, and neurochemical metabolism across regions of the amygdala, hippocampus, frontal cortex, and hypothalamus. We further assess evidence linking dysbiosis of the gut microbiota to neurobehavioral diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder and major depression, drawing upon findings from animal models and human trials. Finally, based on increasing associations between the microbiota, neurophysiology, and behavior, we consider whether investigating mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain axis could lead to novel approaches for treating particular neurological conditions.},

Here, we show that microglial inflammatory signaling determines the immunologic response of the MBH to dietary excess and regulates hypothalamic control of energy homeostasis in mice. Either pharmacologically depleting microglia or selectively restraining microglial NF-κB-dependent signaling sharply reduced microgliosis, an effect that includes prevention of MBH entry by bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells, and greatly limited diet-induced hyperphagia and weight gain. Conversely, forcing microglial activation through cell-specific deletion of the negative NF-κB regulator A20 induced spontaneous MBH microgliosis and cellular infiltration, reduced energy expenditure, and increased both food intake and weight gain even in absence of a dietary challenge. Thus, microglial inflammatory activation, stimulated by dietary excess, orchestrates a multicellular hypothalamic response that mediates obesity susceptibility, providing a mechanistic rationale for non-neuronal approaches to treat metabolic diseases.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease that may involve inflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS). Our objective was to determine whether patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a preclinical stage of AD, have inflammatory characteristics similar to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), a known CNS inflammatory disease. The frequency of lymphocytes and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid of aMCI patients was comparable to MS patients or patients at high risk to develop MS. Thus, brain inflammation occurs early at the preclinical stage of AD and may have an important role in pathology.},

Adaptive immunity, which plays an important role in responding to injury and some diseases of the central nervous system, may contribute to neuroinflammation in AD as well. Communication between the central and peripheral immune systems may also be important in AD. An increased understanding of the physiology of the innate immune system may aid the identification of new therapeutic targets or mechanisms.

	abstract = {The innate immune system is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In contrast, the role of adaptive immunity in AD remains largely unknown. However, numerous clinical trials are testing vaccination strategies for AD, suggesting that T and B cells play a pivotal role in this disease. To test the hypothesis that adaptive immunity influences AD pathogenesis, we generated an immune-deficient AD mouse model that lacks T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells. The resulting “Rag-5xfAD” mice exhibit a greater than twofold increase in β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology. Gene expression analysis of the brain implicates altered innate and adaptive immune pathways, including changes in cytokine/chemokine signaling and decreased Ig-mediated processes. Neuroinflammation is also greatly exacerbated in Rag-5xfAD mice as indicated by a shift in microglial phenotype, increased cytokine production, and reduced phagocytic capacity. In contrast, immune-intact 5xfAD mice exhibit elevated levels of nonamyloid reactive IgGs in association with microglia, and treatment of Rag-5xfAD mice or microglial cells with preimmune IgG enhances Aβ clearance. Last, we performed bone marrow transplantation studies in Rag-5xfAD mice, revealing that replacement of these missing adaptive immune populations can dramatically reduce AD pathology. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that adaptive immune cell populations play an important role in restraining AD pathology. In contrast, depletion of B cells and their appropriate activation by T cells leads to a loss of adaptive–innate immunity cross talk and accelerated disease progression.},

	abstract = {Background: Microglial activation is a hallmark of neuroinflammation, seen in most acute and chronic neuropsychiatric conditions. With growing knowledge about microglia functions in surveying the brain for alterations, microglial activation is increasingly discussed in the context of
disease progression and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain largely unclear. While proper microglial function is essentially required for its scavenging duties, local activation of the brain’s innate immune cells also brings
about many less advantageous changes, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines or degradation of neuroprotective retinoids, and may thus unnecessarily put surrounding healthy neurons in danger. In view of this dilemma, it is little surprising
that both, AD vaccination trials, and also immunosuppressive strategies have consistently failed in AD patients. Nevertheless, epidemiological evidence has suggested a protective effect for anti-inflammatory agents, supporting the hypothesis that key processes involved in the pathogenesis
of AD may take place rather early in the time course of the disorder, likely long before memory impairment becomes clinically evident. Activation of microglia results in a severely altered microenvironment. This is not only caused by the plethora of secreted cytokines, chemokines or ROS,
but may also involve increased turnover of neuroprotective endogenous substances such as retinoic acid (RA), as recently shown in vitro. Results: We discuss findings linking microglial activation and AD and speculate that microglial malfunction, which brings about changes in local RA
concentrations in vitro, may underlie AD pathogenesis and precede or facilitate the onset of AD. Thus, chronic, “innate neuroinflammation” may provide a valuable target for preventive and therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a highly heritable complex disease with no current effective prevention or treatment. The majority of drugs developed for AD focus on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which implicates Aß plaques as a causal factor in the disease. However, it is possible that other underexplored disease-associated pathways may be more fruitful targets for drug development. Findings from gene network analyses implicate immune networks as being enriched in AD; many of the genes in these networks fall within genomic regions that contain common and rare variants that are associated with increased risk of developing AD. Of these genes, several (including CR1, SPI1, the MS4As, TREM2, ABCA7, CD33, and INPP5D) are expressed by microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain. We summarize the gene network and genetics findings that implicate that these microglial genes are involved in AD, as well as several studies that have looked at the expression and function of these genes in microglia and in the context of AD. We propose that these genes are contributing to AD in a non-Aß-dependent fashion.},

	abstract = {Inflammation is an immune activity designed to protect the host from pathogens and noxious agents. In its low-intensity form, presence of an inflammatory process must be inferred from appropriate biomarkers. Occult neuroinflammation is not just secondary to Alzheimer's disease (AD) but may contribute to its pathogenesis and promote its progression. A leaky blood–brain barrier (BBB) has been observed in early AD and may play a role in its initiation and development. Studies of the temporal evolution of AD's biomarkers have shown that, in AD, the brain's amyloid burden correlates poorly with cognitive decline. In contrast, cognitive deficits in AD correlate well with synapse loss. Oligomeric forms of amyloid-beta (oAβs) can be synaptotoxic and evidence of their deposition inside synaptic terminals of cognition-associated neurons explains early memory loss in AD better than formation of extracellular Aβ plaques. Among innate immune cells that reside in the brain, microglia sense danger signals represented by proteins like oAβ and become activated by neuronal damage such as that caused by bacterial endotoxins. The resulting reactive microgliosis has been implicated in generating the chronic form of microglial activation believed to promote AD's development. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have yielded data from patients with sporadic AD indicating that its causes include genetic variation in the innate immune system. Recent preclinical studies have reported that β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB) may protect the brain from the adverse effects of both the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and the deacetylation of histone. Consequently, there is an urgent need for clinical investigations designed to test whether an orally administered βOHB preparation, such as a ketone ester, can have a similar beneficial effect in human subjects.},

Previous studies using selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with several thresholds of nominal significance for pathway analysis determined that the threshold chosen for SNPs can reflect the disease model. Presumably, then, pathway analysis with a stringent threshold to define “associated” SNPs would test the hypothesis that highly associated SNPs are enriched in one or more particular pathways. Here, we selected 599 AD variants (P {\textless} 5.00E−08) to investigate the pathways in which these variants are enriched and the cell types in which these variants are active. Our results showed that AD variants are significantly enriched in pathways of the immune system. Further analysis indicated that AD variants are significantly enriched for enhancers in a number of cell types, in particular the B-lymphocyte, which is the most substantially enriched cell type. This cell type maintains its dominance among the strongest enhancers. AD SNPs also display significant enrichment for DNase in 12 cell types, among which the top 6 significant signals are from immune cell types, including 4 B cells (top 4 significant signals) and CD14+ and CD34+ cells. In summary, our results show that these AD variants with P {\textless} 5.00E−08 are significantly enriched in pathways of the immune system and active in immune cells. To a certain degree, the genetic predisposition for development of AD is rooted in the immune system, rather than in neuronal cells.},

DESIGN: Two independent population-based cohort studies. SETTING: The Rotterdam Study (mean follow-up 4.6 years) and the Leiden 85-plus Study (maximal follow-up 5 years). PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand eight hundred seventy-four individuals, mean age 72, from the Rotterdam Study, and 491 individuals, all aged 85, from the Leiden 85-plus Study. MEASUREMENTS: Both studies assessed global cognition, executive function, and memory. Linear regression analyses were used in the current study to investigate the associations between inflammatory markers and cognitive function and decline. RESULTS: In the Rotterdam Study, higher levels of CRP and IL-6 were cross-sectionally associated with worse global cognition and executive function (P{\textless}.05). ACT was not associated with cognitive function. In the Leiden 85-plus Study, estimates were similar for CRP, although not statistically significant. Higher IL-6 levels were related to a steeper annual decline in memory function in the longitudinal analysis in the Leiden 85-plus Study (P{\textless}.05). The effect of higher IL-6 levels on global and memory function decline was stronger in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 carriers (P-interaction=.01) than in those who were not (P-interaction=.05). In the Rotterdam Study, higher IL-6 levels were related to a steeper annual decline in global cognition in APOE ɛ4 carriers only. CONCLUSION: Systemic markers of inflammation are only moderately associated with cognitive function and decline and tend to be stronger in carriers of the APOE ɛ4 allele. Systemic markers of inflammation are not suitable for risk stratification.},

	abstract = {Inflammation clearly occurs in pathologically vulnerable regions of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain, and it does so with the full complexity of local peripheral inflammatory responses. In the periphery, degenerating tissue and the deposition of highly insoluble abnormal materials are classical stimulants of inflammation. Likewise, in the AD brain damaged neurons and neurites and highly insoluble amyloid β peptide deposits and neurofibrillary tangles provide obvious stimuli for inflammation. Because these stimuli are discrete, microlocalized, and present from early preclinical to terminal stages of AD, local upregulation of complement, cytokines, acute phase reactants, and other inflammatory mediators is also discrete, microlocalized, and chronic. Cumulated over many years, direct and bystander damage from AD inflammatory mechanisms is likely to significantly exacerbate the very pathogenic processes that gave rise to it. Thus, animal models and clinical studies, although still in their infancy, strongly suggest that AD inflammation significantly contributes to AD pathogenesis. By better understanding AD inflammatory and immunoregulatory processes, it should be possible to develop anti-inflammatory approaches that may not cure AD but will likely help slow the progression or delay the onset of this devastating disorder.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Neural circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) support translation of the external environment to an internal map of space, with grid and head direction neurons providing metrics for distance and orientation.
Results
We show here that head direction cells in MEC are organized topographically. Head direction tuning varies widely across the entire dorsoventral MEC axis, but in layer III there is a gradual dorsal-to-ventral increase in the average width of the directional firing field. Sharply tuned cells were encountered only at the dorsal end of MEC. Similar topography was not observed among head direction cells in layers V–VI. At all MEC locations, in all layers, the preferred firing direction (directional phase) showed a uniform distribution. The continuity of the dorsoventral tuning gradient coexisted with discrete topography in the spatial scale of simultaneously recorded grid cells.
Conclusions
The findings point to dorsoventral gradients as a fundamental property of entorhinal circuits, upon which modular organization may be expressed in select subpopulations.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The human parahippocampal gyrus forms a large part of the limbic lobe along the ventromedial part of the temporal cortical mantle. It is a variable and complicated cortex in terms of structure, and the latter is aggravated further by interfaces with the anterior insula anteriorly and the cingulate gyrus and occipital lobe posteriorly. Additional complications relate to its lateral border with the temporal cortex and especially the sulcal configurations that define this junction. The rhinal sulcus, which separates parahippocampal and temporal cortices in other species, including the anthropoid apes, is either lacking or rudimentary in the human brain. Thus, defining this junction requires cytoarchitectural examination and precludes the use of mere inspection of sulcal existing patterns. The cortical areas that form the parahippocampal gyrus are vulnerable to pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its entorhinal and perirhinal subdivisions are both the most heavily damaged cortical areas and the focus for disease onset. The neurons that acquire neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) occupy the junction of the isocortical mantle with the limbic cortical mantle, but share, or partially share, a vulnerability phenotype with large neurons in both domains. The differential expression of this phenotype across time creates the false impression of NFT spread in cross-sectional comparisons of AD brains. The questions of what this phenotype is and why it is expressed first in the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices of the parahippocampal gyrus are the central molecular biological/neuroanatomical questions in understanding the etiology of AD.},

Simulations of bursting neurons and networks explained that relationship 11 and, with competitive learning, demonstrated ﬂexible spatial synchronization patterns when 12 driven by low-dimensional spatial components from the recording data.

	abstract = {The coordinate system has been proposed as a fundamental and cross-culturally used spatial representation, through which people code location and direction information in the environment. Here we provided direct evidence demonstrating that daily experience with the cardinal coordinate system (i.e. east, west, north, and south) contributed to the representation of cognitive maps. Behaviorally, we found that individuals who relied more on the cardinal coordinate system for daily navigation made smaller errors in an indoor pointing task, suggesting that the cardinal coordinate system is an important element of cognitive maps. Neurally, the extent to which individuals relied on the cardinal coordinate system was positively correlated with the gray matter volume of the entorhinal cortex, suggesting that the entorhinal cortex may serve as the neuroanatomical basis of coordinate-based navigation (the entorhinal coordinate area, ECA). Further analyses on the resting-state functional connectivity revealed that the intrinsic interaction between the ECA and two hippocampal sub-regions, the subiculum (Sub) and cornu ammonis (CA), might be linked with the representation precision of cognitive maps. In sum, our study reveals an association between daily experience with the cardinal coordinate system and cognitive maps, and suggests that the ECA works in collaboration with hippocampal sub-regions to represent cognitive maps.},

Looking for power-efﬁcient and embedded solutions for SLAM is an important challenge when building controllers for small and agile robots. Biological neural systems of even simple animals are until now unprecedented in their ability to localize themselves in an unknown environment. Neuromorphic engineering offers ultra low-power and compact computing hardware, in which biologically inspired neuronal architectures for SLAM can be realised. In this paper, we propose a low-power on chip approach for one of the components of SLAM – path integration. Our solution takes inspiration from biology and uses motor command information to estimate the orientation of an agent solely in a spiking neural network. We realise this network on a neuromorphic device that implements artiﬁcial neurons and synapses with analog electronics. A robotic agent receives visual input from an event-based camera and uses this information to correct the onchip spiking neurons’ estimate of orientation. This system can be easily integrated with other localization and mapping components on chip and is a step towards a fully neuromorphic SLAM.},

Models have addressed how neural coding of space and time for memory function could arise, with both dimensions coded by the same neurons. Neural coding could depend upon network oscillatory and attractor dynamics as well as modulation of neuronal intrinsic properties. These models are relevant to the coding of space and time involving structures including the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, striatum and parahippocampal gyrus, which have been implicated in both animal and human studies.},

	abstract = {The hippocampal formation (HF) is implicated in a comparator that detects sensory conflict (mismatch) among convergent inputs. This suggests that new place cells encoding the new configuration with sensory mismatch develop after the HF learns to accept the new configuration as a match. To investigate this issue, HF CA1 place cell activity in rats was analyzed after the adaptation of the rats to the same sensory mismatch condition. The rats were placed on a treadmill on a stage that was translocated in a figure 8-shaped pathway. We recorded HF neuronal activities under 3 conditions; 1) an initial control session, in which both the stage and the treadmill moved forward, 2) a backward (mismatch) session, in which the stage was translocated backward while the rats locomoted forward on the treadmill, and 3) the second control session. Of the 161 HF neurons, 56 place-differential activities were recorded from the HF CA1 subfield. These place-differential activities were categorized into 4 types; forward-related, backward-related, both-translocation-related, and session-dependent. Forward-related activities showed predominant spatial firings in the forward sessions, while backward-related activities showed predominant spatial firings in the backward sessions. Both-translocation-related activities showed consistent spatial firings in both the forward and backward conditions. On the other hand, session-dependent activities showed different spatial firings across the sessions. Detailed analyses of the place fields indicated that mean place field sizes were larger in the forward-related, backward-related, and both-translocation-related activities than in the session-dependent activities. Furthermore, firing rate distributions in the place fields were negatively skewed and asymmetric, which is similar to place field changes that occur after repeated experience. These results demonstrate that the HF encodes a naturally impossible new configuration of sensory inputs after adaptation, suggesting that the HF is capable of updating its stored memory to accept a new configuration as a match by repeated experience.},

Persistent head direction signals are transmitted from anterior thalamus to the presubiculum, but the identity of the presubicular target neurons, their connectivity and function in local microcircuits are unknown. Here, we examine how thalamic afferents recruit presubicular principal neurons and Martinotti interneurons, and the ensuing synaptic interactions between these cells. Pyramidal neuron activation of Martinotti cells in superficial layers is strongly facilitating such that high-frequency head directional stimulation efficiently unmutes synaptic excitation. Martinotti-cell feedback plays a dual role: precisely timed spikes may not inhibit the firing of in-tune head direction cells, while exerting lateral inhibition. Autonomous attractor dynamics emerge from a modelled network implementing wiring motifs and timing sensitive synaptic interactions in the pyramidal—Martinotti-cell feedback loop. This inhibitory microcircuit is therefore tuned to refine and maintain head direction information in the presubiculum.},

This study assessed whether PoS and ADN HD cells would be similarly responsive to nonvisual or unfamiliar environmental cues. After visual input was eliminated by blindfolding the rats, HD cells maintained direction-specific discharge, but their preferred firing directions became less stable. In addition, rotations of the behavioral apparatus indicated that some nonvisual cues (presumably tactile, olfactory, or both) exerted above chance stimulus control over a cell's preferred firing direction. However, a prominent auditory cue was not effective in exerting stimulus control over a cell's preferred direction. HD cell activity also was assessed after rotation of a novel visual cue exposed to the rat for 1, 3, or 8 min. An 8-min exposure was enough time for a novel visual cue to gain control over a cell's preferred direction, whereas an exposure of 1 or 3 min led to control in only about half the sessions. These latter results indicate that HD cells rely on a rapid learning mechanism to develop associations with landmark cues. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In particular, rats with dysgranular retrosplenial lesions were less reliant on distal visual cues to control performance of a working memory task in the radial-arm maze. Instead, they were more reliant on using a motor turning strategy to solve the task.

	abstract = {Summary
Memory relies on lasting adaptations of neuronal properties elicited by stimulus-driven plastic changes [1]. The strengthening (and weakening) of synapses results in the establishment of functional ensembles. It is presumed that such ensembles (or engrams) are activated during memory acquisition and re-activated upon memory retrieval. The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) has emerged as a key brain area supporting memory [2], including episodic and topographical memory in humans [3, 4, 5], as well as spatial memory in rodents [6, 7]. Dysgranular RSC is densely connected with dorsal stream visual areas [8] and contains place-like and head-direction cells, making it a prime candidate for integrating navigational information [9]. While previous reports [6, 10] describe the recruitment of RSC ensembles during navigational tasks, such ensembles have never been tracked long enough to provide evidence of stable engrams and have not been related to the retention of long-term memory. Here, we used in vivo 2-photon imaging to analyze patterns of activity of over 6,000 neurons within dysgranular RSC. Eight mice were trained on a spatial memory task. Learning was accompanied by the gradual emergence of a context-specific pattern of neuronal activity over a 3-week period, which was re-instated upon retrieval more than 3 weeks later. The stability of this memory engram was predictive of the degree of forgetting; more stable engrams were associated with better performance. This provides direct evidence for the interdependence of spatial memory consolidation and RSC engram formation. Our results demonstrate the participation of RSC in spatial memory storage at the level of neuronal ensembles.},

Previous studies have identified the benefits of cognitive enrichment on reducing disease pathology. Additionally, epidemiological and clinical data suggest that repeated exercise, and cognitive and social enrichment, can improve and/or delay the cognitive deficiencies associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, 3xTg-AD mice were exposed to a rigorous training routine beginning at 3 months of age, which consisted of repeated training in the Morris water maze spatial recognition task every 3 months, ending at 18 months of age. At the conclusion of the final Morris water maze training session, animals subsequently underwent testing in another hippocampus-dependent spatial task, the Barnes maze task, and on the more cortical-dependent novel object recognition memory task. Our data show that periodic cognitive enrichment throughout aging, via multiple learning episodes in the Morris water maze task, can improve the memory performance of aged 3xTg-AD mice in a separate spatial recognition task, and in a preference memory task, when compared to naïve aged matched 3xTg-AD mice. Furthermore, we observed that the cognitive enrichment properties of Morris water maze exposer, was detectable in repeatedly trained animals as early as 6 months of age. These findings suggest early repeated cognitive enrichment can mitigate the diverse cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer’s disease.},

Here we present the novel findings that longitudinal water-maze spatial training produces a significant, albeit transient, improvement in subsequent learning performance and reduces amyloid β (Aβ) and tau neuropathology. The 3xTg-AD mice were trained and tested at 3 month intervals from 2 to 18 months. Separate groups of naive mice were also tested at each age. The improvement in performance seen at 6 and 12 months is dependent on spatial training, because animals that were similarly handled and exposed to swimming without a learning contingency failed to show improved performance. Training before the development of overt neuropathology is required for full expression of the training effect because we found it delays Aβ redistribution to extracellular plaques and reduces Aβ oligomers associated with cognitive decline. In addition, learning leads to decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3β activity, which likely underlies the reduced tau pathology. The previous training effects on both maze performance and neuropathology are attenuated at 15 and 18 months. These findings indicate that, in young and middle-aged 3xTg-AD mice, repeated spatial training can significantly delay the development of neuropathology and decline in spatial memory.},

We review models and experimental evidence for three systems in the rat brain that are presumed to be components of the rat's navigational and memory system. Head-direction cells have been modeled as a ring attractor, grid cells as a plane attractor, and place cells both as a plane attractor and as a point attractor.

Here we correlated the structural and physiological properties of single neurons of the presubiculum in vitro. Unsupervised cluster analysis based on dendritic length and form, soma location, firing pattern and action potential properties allowed us to classify principal neurons into three major cell types. Cluster 1 consisted of a population of small regular spiking principal cells in layers II/III. Cluster 2 contained intrinsically burst firing pyramidal cells of layer IV, with a resting potential close to threshold. Cluster 3 included regular spiking cells of layers V and VI, and could be divided into subgroups 3.1 and 3.2. Cells of cluster 3.1 included pyramidal, multiform and inverted pyramidal cells. Cells of cluster 3.2 contained high-resistance pyramidal neurons that fired readily in response to somatic current injection. These data show that presubicular principal cells generally conform to neurons of the periarchicortex. However, the presence of intrinsic bursting cells in layer IV distinguishes the presubicular cortex from the neighbouring entorhinal cortex. The firing frequency adaptation was very low for principal cells of clusters 1 and 3, a property that should assist the generation of maintained head direction signals in vivo.},

The presubiculum (PrS) is part of an interconnected network of distributed brain regions where individual neurons signal the animals heading direction. PrS sends axons to medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), it is reciprocally connected with anterior thalamic nuclei (ATNs), and it sends feedback projections to the lateral mammillary nucleus (LMN), involved in generating the head direction signal. The intrinsic properties of projecting neurons will influence the pathway-specific transmission of activity. Here, we used projection-specific labeling of presubicular neurons to identify MEC-, LMN-, and ATN-projecting neurons in mice. MEC-projecting neurons located in superficial layers II/III were mostly regular spiking pyramidal neurons, and we also identified a Martinotti-type GABAergic neuron. The cell bodies of LMN-projecting neurons were located in a well-delimited area in the middle portion of the PrS, which corresponds to layer IV. The physiology of LMN projecting, pyramidal neurons stood out with a tendency to fire in bursts of action potentials (APs) with rapid onset. These properties may be uniquely adapted to reliably transmit visual landmark information with short latency to upstream LMN. Neurons projecting to ATN were located in layers V/VI, and they were mostly regular spiking pyramidal neurons. Unsupervised cluster analysis of intrinsic properties suggested distinct physiological features for the different categories of projection neurons, with some similarities between MEC- and ATN-projecting neurons. Projection-specific subpopulations may serve separate functions in the PrS and may be engaged differently in transmitting head direction related information.},

We found that layer2 is composed of two principal cell populations (calbindin-positive and calbindin-negative neurons) which targeted the contralateral PreS and retrosplenial cortex, respectively. Layer3 pyramidal neurons projected to the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). By juxtacellularly recording PreS neurons in awake rats during passive-rotation, we found that head-direction responses were preferentially contributed by layer3 pyramidal cells, whose long-range axons branched within layer3 of the MEC. In contrast, layer2 neurons displayed distinct spike-shapes, were not modulated by head-direction but rhythmically-entrained by theta-oscillations. Fast-spiking interneurons showed only weak directionality and theta-rhythmicity, but were significantly modulated by angular velocity. Our data thus indicate that PreS neurons differentially contribute to head-direction coding, and point to a cell-type- and layer-specific routing of directional and non-directional information to downstream cortical targets., DOI:

	abstract = {Primates rely predominantly on vision to gather information from the environment and neurons representing visual space and gaze position are found in many brain areas. Within the medial temporal lobe, a brain region critical for memory, neurons in the entorhinal cortex of macaque monkeys exhibit spatial selectivity for gaze position. Specifically, the firing rate of single neurons reflects fixation location within a visual image (Killian et al., 2012). In the rodents, entorhinal cells such as grid cells, border cells, and head direction cells show spatial representations aligned to visual environmental features instead of the body (Hafting et al., 2005; Sargolini et al., 2006; Solstad et al., 2008; Diehl et al., 2017). However, it is not known whether similar allocentric representations exist in primate entorhinal cortex. Here, we recorded neural activity in the entorhinal cortex in two male rhesus monkeys during a naturalistic, free-viewing task. Our data reveal that a majority of entorhinal neurons represent gaze position and that simultaneously recorded neurons represent gaze position relative to distinct spatial reference frames, with some neurons aligned to the visual image and others aligned to the monkey's head position. Our results also show that entorhinal neural activity can be used to predict gaze position with a high degree of accuracy. These findings demonstrate that visuospatial representation is a fundamental property of entorhinal neurons in primates and suggest that entorhinal cortex may support relational memory and motor planning by coding attentional locus in distinct, behaviorally relevant frames of reference.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The entorhinal cortex, a brain area important for memory, shows striking spatial activity in rodents through grid cells, border cells, head direction cells, and nongrid spatial cells. The majority of entorhinal neurons signal the location of a rodent relative to visual environmental cues, representing the location of the animal relative to space in the world instead of the body. Recently, we found that entorhinal neurons can signal location of gaze while a monkey explores images visually. Here, we report that spatial entorhinal neurons are widespread in the monkey and these neurons are capable of showing a world-based spatial reference frame locked to the bounds of explored images. These results help connect the extensive findings in rodents to the primate.},

In many nonhuman species, neural computations of navigational information such as position and orientation are not tied to a specific sensory modality [1, 2]. Rather, spatial signals are integrated from multiple input sources, likely leading to abstract representations of space. In contrast, the potential for abstract spatial representations in humans is not known, because most neuroscientific experiments on human navigation have focused exclusively on visual cues. Here, we tested the modality independence hypothesis with two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments that characterized computations in regions implicated in processing spatial layout [3]. According to the hypothesis, such regions should be recruited for spatial computation of 3D geometric configuration, independent of a specific sensory modality. In support of this view, sighted participants showed strong activation of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) for visual and haptic exploration of information-matched scenes but not objects. Functional connectivity analyses suggested that these effects were not related to visual recoding, which was further supported by a similar preference for haptic scenes found with blind participants. Taken together, these findings establish the PPA/RSC network as critical in modality-independent spatial computations and provide important evidence for a theory of high-level abstract spatial information processing in the human brain.},

	abstract = {Spatial navigation is a multisensory process involving integration of visual and body-based cues. In rodents, head direction (HD) cells, which are most abundant in the thalamus, integrate these cues to code facing direction. Human fMRI studies examining HD coding in virtual environments (VE) have reported effects in retrosplenial complex and (pre-)subiculum, but not the thalamus. Furthermore, HD coding appeared insensitive to global landmarks. These tasks, however, provided only visual cues for orientation, and attending to global landmarks did not benefit task performance. In the present study, participants explored a VE comprising four separate locales, surrounded by four global landmarks. To provide body-based cues, participants wore a head-mounted display so that physical rotations changed facing direction in the VE. During subsequent MRI scanning, subjects saw stationary views of the environment and judged whether their orientation was the same as in the preceding trial. Parameter estimates extracted from retrosplenial cortex and the thalamus revealed significantly reduced BOLD responses when HD was repeated. Moreover, consistent with rodent findings, the signal did not continue to adapt over repetitions of the same HD. These results were supported by a whole-brain analysis showing additional repetition suppression in the precuneus. Together, our findings suggest that: (1) consistent with the rodent literature, the human thalamus may integrate visual and body-based, orientation cues; (2) global reference frame cues can be used to integrate HD across separate individual locales; and (3) immersive training procedures providing full body-based cues may help to elucidate the neural mechanisms supporting spatial navigation.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In rodents, head direction (HD) cells signal facing direction in the environment via increased firing when the animal assumes a certain orientation. Distinct brain regions, the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and thalamus, code for visual and vestibular cues of orientation, respectively. Putative HD signals have been observed in human RSC but not the thalamus, potentially because body-based cues were not provided. Here, participants encoded HD in a novel virtual environment while wearing a head-mounted display to provide body-based cues for orientation. In subsequent fMRI scanning, we found evidence of an HD signal in RSC, thalamus, and precuneus. These findings harmonize rodent and human data, and suggest that immersive training procedures provide a viable way to examine the neural basis of navigation.},

Here, we review how looking behavior is guided by memory in several ways, some of which have been shown to depend on the hippocampus, and how hippocampal neural signals are modulated by eye movements. Taken together, these findings highlight the need for future research on how MTL structures interact with the oculomotor system. Probing how the hippocampus reflects and impacts motor output during looking behavior renders a practical path to advance our understanding of the hippocampal memory system.},

We propose a quantitative framework whereby this drive represents a multisensory self-motion estimate computed through an internal model that uses sensory prediction errors of vestibular, visual, and somatosensory cues to improve on-line motor drive. We show how restraint-dependent strength of recurrent connections within the attractor can explain differences in head direction cell firing between free foraging and restrained passive rotation. We also summarize recent findings on how gravity influences azimuth coding, indicating that the velocity drive is not purely egocentric. Finally, we show that the internal compass may be three-dimensional and hypothesize that the additional vertical degrees of freedom use global allocentric gravity cues.},

Significant saccade direction encoding was found in 20\% of the cells recorded in the posterior EC. SD cells were generally broadly tuned and two largely separate populations of SD cells encoded future and previous saccade direction. Some properties of these cells resemble those of head-direction cells in rodent EC, suggesting that the same neural circuitry may be capable of performing homologous spatial computations under different exploratory contexts.},

Compared to unlesioned control animals, lesioned animals were impaired on two spatial tasks, a radial eight-arm maze task and a Morris water task, although the performance scores of both lesion groups improved over the course of behavioral testing. In contrast, lesioned animals were unimpaired on two nonspatial tasks, a cued version of the water maze task and a conditioned taste-aversion, paradigm.

A decrease in Fos levels was also found in the rostral and caudal retrosplenial cortex but not in the parahippocampal cortices or anterior cingulate cortices.

The MEC contains cells that fire as a function of the animal's head direction (HD), as well as grid cells that fire in multiple locations in an environment, forming a repeating hexagonal pattern. The MEC receives inputs from widespread areas of the cortical mantle including the ventral visual stream, which processes object recognition information, as well as information about visual landmarks. The role of the MEC in processing the HD signal or landmark information is unclear. We addressed this issue by neurotoxically damaging the MEC and recording HD cells within the anterodorsal thalamus (ADN). Direction-specific activity was present in the ADN of all animals with MEC lesions. Moreover, the discharge characteristics of ADN HD cells were only mildly affected by MEC lesions, with HD cells exhibiting greater anticipation of future HDs. Tests of landmark control revealed that HD cells in lesioned rats were capable of accurately updating their preferred firing directions in relation to a salient visual cue. Furthermore, cells from lesioned animals maintained stable preferred firing directions when locomoting in darkness and demonstrated stable HD cell tuning when locomoting into a novel enclosure, suggesting that MEC lesions did not disrupt the integration of idiothetic cues, or angular path integration, by HD cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that the MEC plays a limited role in the formation and spatial updating of the HD cell signal. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

HD cells from lesioned animals had similar firing properties compared to controls and their preferred firing directions shifted a corresponding amount following rotation of the major visual landmark. Because animals were not exposed to the visual landmark until after surgical recovery, these results provide evidence that the PPC is not necessary for visual landmark control or the establishment of landmark stability. Further, cells from lesioned animals maintained a stable preferred firing direction when they foraged in the dark and were only slightly less stable than controls when they self-locomoted into a novel enclosure.

	abstract = {The laterodorsal nucleus (LDN) of the thalamus provides a prominent afferent projection to the postsubiculum (dorsal presubiculum). To characterize synaptic transmission in this pathway, we placed stimulating electrodes in the LDN and recorded fEPSPs elicited in the postsubiculum of urethane-anesthetized rats. LDN stimulation elicited a source-sink dipole between the deep and superficial layers of the postsubiculum, respectively, consistent with anatomical evidence for the termination of thalamic afferents in the superficial layers of the structure, and the existence of deep layer neurons with apical dendrites extending into these layers. Postsubicular fEPSPs were typically 0.5–1.0 mV in amplitude, with a peak latency of approximately 6 ms. Consistent with anatomical observations, the short onset latency of fEPSPs elicited by LDN stimulation, and their ability to follow a 60-Hz train of stimulation, indicate that the projection is monosynaptic. Paired-pulse stimulation revealed pronounced paired-pulse depression that was maximal at 100 ms, suggesting that initial release probabilities are high at LDN-postsubiculum synapses, in common with many neocortical pathways. A conventional tetanus protocol that yields LTP in hippocampal pathways had no effect on postsubicular fEPSPs, but long-term depression could be induced by 60-Hz stimulation. Drug infusion studies revealed that synaptic transmission in the LDN-postsubiculum projection is predominantly AMPA-receptor mediated. Rats were implanted with indwelling infusion cannulae targeting the postsubiculum, and, after a recovery period, were anaesthetized withurethane, and implanted with stimulating and recording electrodes. Infusion of CNQX almost completely abolished postsubicular fEPSPs, whereas D-AP5 had little effect. However, 60-Hz LTD was blocked by D-AP5 infusion, revealing that this form of synaptic plasticity is NMDA-receptor dependent. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Rats with complete fornix lesions or cytotoxic lesions placed in the anterior thalamic region were trained on an allocentric spatial memory test (the Morris water maze). While both lesions led to impairments in locating the hidden platform in this test of reference memory, the thalamic lesions led to a significantly greater deficit than that observed after fornix transection as measured by a number of performance indices. The lesions also led to different patterns of swim behaviour in the pool. The severity of the thalamic lesion deficit was associated with anterior thalamic nuclei damage but not with damage to the nucleus medialis dorsalis. Both the fornix and the thalamic lesions also severely impaired T-maze alternation. In contrast, neither set of lesions appeared to affect the recognition of small or large objects. While the study provides further evidence of a close functional relationship between the hippocampus and the anterior thalamic nuclei, it also shows that disconnection of the fornical inputs to the anterior thalamic nuclei does not provide a full explanation of the thalamic deficit.},

	abstract = {Vestibular information influences spatial orientation and navigation in laboratory animals and humans. Neurons within the rat anterior thalamus encode the directional heading of the animal in absolute space. These neurons, referred to as head direction (HD) cells, fire selectively when the rat points its head in a specific direction in the horizontal plane with respect to the external laboratory reference frame. HD cells are thought to represent an essential component of a neural network that processes allocentric spatial information. The functional properties of HD cells may be dependent on vestibular input. Here, anterior thalamic HD cells were recorded before and after sodium arsanilate-induced vestibular system lesion. Vestibular lesions abolished the directional firing properties of HD cells. The time course of disruption in the directional firing properties paralleled the loss of vestibular function. Arsanilate-treated rats exhibited only minor changes in locomotor behavior, which were unlikely to account for the loss of direction-specific firing. Vestibular lesions also disrupted the influence of angular head velocity on anterior thalamic single-unit firing rates. Finally, a subset of anterior thalamic neurons recorded from vestibular-lesioned rats exhibited a pattern of intermittent firing bursts that were distinctly unrelated to HD. This novel anterior thalamic firing pattern has not been encountered in any vestibular-intact rat. These data suggest that: (1) the neural code for directional bearing is critically dependent on vestibular information; and (2) this loss of HD cell information may represent a neurobiological mechanism to account for the orientation and navigational deficits observed after vestibular dysfunction.},

These lesions were made by injecting N-methyl-d-aspartate acid (NMDA). These rats, and a group of surgical controls (SHAM), were trained on a rewarded forced-alternation task in a T-maze. While the selective AM and AV/AD lesions prduced an initial acquisition impairment, only the animals with combined lesions (ANT.T) showed a persistent deficit throughout the 16 acquisition sessions. Subsequent testing with a cross-maze confirmed that the SHAM, AV/AD, and AM groups were able to use allocentric cues, while the ANT.T group were impaired. In contrast none of the three anterior thalamic groups were impaired on a subsequent egocentric discrimination and reversal task run in the same apparatus. A final test using the eight arm radial-maze, revealed marked deficits in the ANT.T group as well as milder deficits in the AV/AD group. The results from these experiments help to confirm the importance of the anterior thalamic nuclei for allocentric tasks, but suggest that no region is pre-eminently important. The findings also help to account for other studies which have reported that anterior thalamic lesions have seemingly mild effects on tests of spatial memory.},

When the alternation task was changed, so as to increase proactive interference, the impairment associated with mamillary body damage became more evident and was now equal in severity to that in the animals with anterior thalamic lesions. The fornix lesion group were the most impaired. In contrast, all three groups performed normally on a test of object recognition. The results add weight to the view that hippocampal — anterior thalamic connections are critical for normal spatial memory and that the relative contribution of the mamillary bodies is task dependent.},

In each session, the monkey learned a new list of these unique scenes. The animals then underwent surgical ablation of either the anterior thalamic nuclei or the cingulate cortex. It was found that the animals with anterior thalamic lesions showed a substantial impairment, whereas the monkeys with cingulate cortex ablations were not significantly impaired at the task.

	abstract = {Many neurons in the rat lateral mammillary nuclei (LMN) fire selectively in relation to the animal's head direction (HD) in the horizontal plane independent of the rat's location or behavior. One hypothesis of how this representation is generated and updated is via subcortical projections from the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN). Here we report the type of activity in DTN neurons. The majority of cells (75\%) fired as a function of the rat's angular head velocity (AHV). Cells exhibited one of two types of firing patterns: (1) symmetric, in which the firing rate was positively correlated with AHV during head turns in both directions, and (2) asymmetric, in which the firing rate was positively correlated with head turns in one direction and correlated either negatively or not at all in the opposite direction. In addition to modulation by AHV, some of the AHV cells (40.1\%) were weakly modulated by the rat's linear velocity, and a smaller number were modulated by HD (11\%) or head pitch (15.9\%). Autocorrelation analyses indicated that with the head stationary, AHV cells displayed irregular discharge patterns. Because afferents from the DTN are the major source of information projecting to the LMN, these results suggest that AHV information from the DTN plays a significant role in generating the HD signal in LMN. A model is proposed showing how DTN AHV cells can generate and update the LMN HD cell signal.},

	abstract = {Previous research has identified neurons in the postsubiculum (PoS) and anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus (AD) of the rat that discharge as a function of the animal’s head direction. In addition, anatomical studies have shown that the AD and PoS are reciprocally connected with one another. The current study examined whether head direction (HD) cells in each of the two areas is dependent on input from the other structure. After both electrolytic or neurotoxic lesions of the AD, no cells were identified with direction-specific discharge in the PoS. In contrast, AD HD cell activity was still present after neurotoxic lesions to the PoS. However, AD HD cells in PoS-lesioned rats exhibited three important differences compared with AD HD cells in intact animals: (1) their directional firing range was significantly larger, (2) their firing predicted the animal’s future head direction by a larger amount, and (3) their preferred firing direction was substantially less influenced by a prominent visual landmark within the recording environment. These results indicate that information critical for HD cell activity is conveyed in both directions between the AD and the PoS; whereas the AD is necessary for the presence of HD cell activity in the PoS, the PoS appears important in allowing visual landmarks to exert control over the preferred firing direction of AD HD cells. These findings have implications for several computational models that propose to account for the generation of the HD cell signal.},

This narrowing effect does not occur for ATN HD cells. We also found that the HD signal in LMN leads that in ATN by about 15–20 ms.

	abstract = {Head direction (HD) cells are neurons found in the hippocampal formation and connected areas that ﬁre as a function of an animal’s directional orientation relative to its environment [1, 2]. They integrate self-motion and environmental sensory information to update directional heading [3]. Visual landmarks, in particular, exert strong control over the preferred direction of HD cell ﬁring [4]. The HD signal has previously been shown to appear adult-like as early as postnatal day 16 (P16) in the rat pup, just after eye opening and coinciding with the ﬁrst spontaneous exploration of its environment [5, 6]. In order to determine whether the HD circuit can begin its organization prior to the onset of patterned vision, we recorded from the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (ADN) and its postsynaptic target in the hippocampal formation, the dorsal pre-subiculum (PrSd), before and after eye opening in pre-weanling rats. We ﬁnd that HD cells can be recorded at the earliest age sampled (P12), several days before eye opening. However, this early HD signal displays low directional information content and lacks stability both within and across trials. Following eye opening, the HD system matures rapidly, as more cells exhibit directional ﬁring, and the quality and reliability of the directional signal improves dramatically. Cue-rotation experiments show that a prominent visual landmark is able to control HD responses within 24 hr of eye opening. Together, the results suggest that the directional network can be organized independently of visual spatial information while demonstrating the importance of patterned vision for accurate and reliable orientation in space.},

	abstract = {Head-direction (HD) cells in subcortical areas of the mammalian brain are tuned to a particular head direction in space; a population of such neurons forms a neural compass that may be relevant for spatial navigation. The development of neural circuits constituting the head-direction system is poorly understood. Inspired by electrophysiological experiments about the role of recurrent synaptic connections, we investigate a learning rule that teaches neurons to amplify feed-forward inputs. We simulate random head movements of a rat, during which neurons receive both visual and vestibular (head-velocity) inputs. Remarkably, as recurrent connections learn to amplify exclusively the visual inputs, a neural network emerges that performs spatio-temporal integration. That is, during head movements in darkness, neurons resemble HD cells by maintaining a ﬁxed tuning to head direction. The proposed learning rule exhibits similarities with known forms of anti-Hebbian synaptic plasticity. We conclude that selective ampliﬁcation could serve as a general principle for the synaptic development of multimodal feedback circuits in the brain. © 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Head-direction (HD) cells in subcortical areas of the mammalian brain are tuned to a particular head direction in space; a population of such neurons forms a neural compass that may be relevant for spatial navigation. The development of neural circuits constituting the head-direction system is poorly understood. Inspired by electrophysiological experiments about the role of recurrent synaptic connections, we investigate a learning rule that teaches neurons to amplify feed-forward inputs. We simulate random head movements of a rat, during which neurons receive both visual and vestibular (head-velocity) inputs. Remarkably, as recurrent connections learn to amplify exclusively the visual inputs, a neural network emerges that performs spatio-temporal integration. That is, during head movements in darkness, neurons resemble HD cells by maintaining a fixed tuning to head direction. The proposed learning rule exhibits similarities with known forms of anti-Hebbian synaptic plasticity. We conclude that selective amplification could serve as a general principle for the synaptic development of multimodal feedback circuits in the brain.},

	abstract = {The role of intrinsic cortical dynamics is a debatable issue. A recent optical imaging study (Kenet et al., 2003) found that activity patterns similar to orientation maps (OMs), emerge in the primary visual cortex (V1) even in the absence of sensory input, suggesting an intrinsic mechanism of OM activation. To better understand these results and shed light on the intrinsic V1 processing, we suggest a neural network model in which OMs are encoded by the intrinsic lateral connections. The proposed connectivity pattern depends on the preferred orientation and, unlike previous models, on the degree of orientation selectivity of the interconnected neurons. We prove that the network has a ring attractor composed of an approximated version of the OMs. Consequently, OMs emerge spontaneously when the network is presented with an unstructured noisy input. Simulations show that the model can be applied to experimental data and generate realistic OMs. We study a variation of the model with spatially restricted connections, and show that it gives rise to states composed of several OMs. We hypothesize that these states can represent local properties of the visual scene.},

Here we studied the mechanism by which head direction cells are principally anchored to background visual cues [M.B. Zugaro et al. (2001) J. Neurosci., 21, RC154,1–5]. Anterodorsal thalamic head direction cells were recorded while the rat foraged on a small elevated platform in a 3-m diameter cylindrical enclosure. A large card was placed in the background, near the curtain, and a smaller card was placed in the foreground, near the platform. The cards were identically marked, proportionally dimensioned, subtended the same visual angles from the central vantage point and separated by 90°. The rat was then disoriented in darkness, the cards were rotated by 90° in opposite directions about the center and the rat was returned. Preferred directions followed either the background card, foreground card or midpoint between the two cards. In continuous lighting, preferred directions shifted to follow the background cue in most cases (30 of the 53 experiments, Batschelet V-test, P {\textless} 0.01). Stroboscopic illumination, which perturbs dynamic visual signals (e.g. motion parallax), blocked this selectivity. Head direction cells remained equally anchored to the background card, foreground card or configuration of the two cards (Watson test, P {\textgreater} 0.1). This shows that dynamic visual signals are critical in distinguishing typically more stable background cues which govern spatial neuronal responses and orientation behaviors.},

Theoretical studies, in conjunction with recent empirical discoveries, suggest that the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) might perform some of the essential underlying computations by means of a unique, periodic synaptic matrix that could be self-organized in early development through a simple, symmetry-breaking operation. The scale at which space is represented increases systematically along the dorsoventral axis in both the hippocampus and the MEC, apparently because of systematic variation in the gain of a movement-speed signal. Convergence of spatially periodic input at multiple scales, from so-called grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, might result in non-periodic spatial firing patterns (place fields) in the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors facilitate extinction of rewarding memory of drug taking. However, little is known about the role of chromatin modification in the extinction of aversive memory of drug withdrawal. In this study, we used conditioned place aversion (CPA), a highly sensitive model for measuring aversive memory of drug withdrawal, to investigate the role of epigenetic regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression in extinction of aversive memory. We found that CPA extinction training induced an increase in recruiting cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) to and acetylation of histone H3 at the promoters of BDNF exon I transcript and increased BDNF mRNA and protein expression in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) of acute morphine-dependent rats and that such epigenetic regulation of BDNF gene transcription could be facilitated or diminished by intra-vmPFC infusion of HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(methylthio)butadiene) before extinction training. Correspondingly, disruption of the epigenetic regulation of BDNF gene transcription with U0126 or suppression of BDNF signaling with Trk receptor antagonist K252a or BDNF scavenger tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB)-Fc blocked extinction of CPA behavior. We also found that extinction training-induced activation of ERK and CREB and extinction of CPA behavior could be potentiated or suppressed by intra-vmPFC infusion of d-cycloserine, a NMDA receptor partial agonist or aminophosphonopentanoic acid, a NMDA receptor antagonist. We conclude that extinction of aversive memory of morphine withdrawal requires epigenetic regulation of BDNF gene transcription in the vmPFC through activation of the ERK-CREB signaling pathway perhaps in a NMDA receptor-dependent manner.},

Here, we summarize data from studies that further characterized this incubation phenomenon and briefly discuss its implications for drug addiction. The main findings of our ongoing research are:1.Incubation of cocaine craving is long-lasting, but not permanent: cocaine seeking induced by exposure to cocaine cues remains elevated for up to 3 months of withdrawal, but decreases after 6 months.2.Incubation of reward craving is not drug specific: sucrose seeking induced by re-exposure to the reward cues also increases after withdrawal, but for a time period that is shorter than that of cocaine.3.Incubation of cocaine craving is not evident after acute re-exposure to cocaine itself: cocaine seeking induced by cocaine priming injections remains essentially unchanged over the first 6 months of withdrawal.4.Incubation of cocaine craving after withdrawal is associated with increases in the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mesolimbic dopamine areas.},

Here, we explored the role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, a brain area previously implicated in cue-induced cocaine seeking) in this incubation. We trained rats to self-administer cocaine for 10days (6h/day, infusions were paired with a tone–light cue), and then assessed after 1 or 30 withdrawal days the effect of exposure to cocaine cues on lever presses in extinction tests. We found that cue-induced cocaine-seeking in the extinction tests was higher after 30 withdrawal days than after 1day. The time-dependent increases in extinction responding were associated with large (ventral mPFC) or modest (dorsal mPFC) increases in ERK phosphorylation (a measure of ERK activity and an index of neuronal activation). After 30 withdrawal days, ventral but not dorsal injections of muscimol+baclofen (GABAa+GABAb receptor agonists that inhibit neuronal activity) decreased extinction responding. After 1 withdrawal day, ventral but not dorsal mPFC injections of bicuculline+saclofen (GABAa+GABAb receptor antagonists that increase neuronal activity) strongly increased extinction responding. Finally, muscimol+baclofen had minimal effect on extinction responding after 1day, and in cocaine-experienced rats, ventral mPFC injections of muscimol+baclofen or bicuculline+saclofen had no effect on lever presses for an oral sucrose solution. The present results indicate that ventral mPFC neuronal activity plays an important role in the incubation of cocaine craving.},

Activation of brain stress systems is hypothesized to be key to the negative emotional state produced by dependence that drives drug seeking through negative reinforcement mechanisms. This review explores the role of brain stress systems (corticotropin-releasing factor, norepinephrine, orexin [hypocretin], vasopressin, dynorphin) and brain antistress systems (neuropeptide Y, nociceptin [orphanin FQ]) in drug dependence, with emphasis on the neuropharmacological function of extrahypothalamic systems in the extended amygdala. The brain stress and antistress systems may play a key role in the transition to and maintenance of drug dependence once initiated. Understanding the role of brain stress and antistress systems in addiction provides novel targets for treatment and prevention of addiction and insights into the organization and function of basic brain emotional circuitry.},

	abstract = {Addiction is often characterized by intense motivation for a drug, which may be narrowly focused at the expense of other rewards. Here, we examined the role of amygdala-related circuitry in the amplification and narrowing of motivation focus for intravenous cocaine. We paired optogenetic channelrhodopsin (ChR2) stimulation in either central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) or basolateral amygdala (BLA) of female rats with one particular nose-poke porthole option for earning cocaine infusions (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.). A second alternative porthole earned identical cocaine but without ChR2 stimulation. Consequently, CeA rats quickly came to pursue their CeA ChR2-paired cocaine option intensely and exclusively, elevating cocaine intake while ignoring their alternative cocaine alone option. By comparison, BLA ChR2 pairing failed to enhance cocaine motivation. CeA rats also emitted consummatory bites toward their laser-paired porthole, suggesting that higher incentive salience made that cue more attractive. A separate progressive ratio test of incentive motivation confirmed that CeA ChR2 amplified rats' motivation, raising their breakpoint effort price for cocaine by 10-fold. However, CeA ChR2 laser on its own lacked any reinforcement value: laser by itself was never self-stimulated, not even by the same rats in which it amplified motivation for cocaine. Conversely, CeA inhibition by muscimol/baclofen microinjections prevented acquisition of cocaine self-administration and laser preference, whereas CeA inhibition by optogenetic halorhodopsin suppressed cocaine intake, indicating that CeA circuitry is needed for ordinary cocaine motivation. We conclude that CeA ChR2 excitation paired with a cocaine option specifically focuses and amplifies motivation to produce intense pursuit and consumption focused on that single target.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In addiction, intense incentive motivation often becomes narrowly focused on a particular drug of abuse. Here we show that pairing central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) optogenetic stimulation with one option for earning intravenous cocaine makes that option almost the exclusive focus of intense pursuit and consumption. CeA stimulation also elevated the effort cost rats were willing to pay for cocaine and made associated cues become intensely attractive. However, we also show that CeA laser had no reinforcing properties at all when given alone for the same rats. Therefore, CeA laser pairing makes its associated cocaine option and cues become powerfully attractive in a nearly addictive fashion.},

	abstract = {Pavlovian conditioned cues exert a powerful influence on instrumental actions directed towards a common reward, this is known as Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT). The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) has been hypothesized to function as an interface between limbic cortical structures required for associative conditioning, like the amygdala, and response mechanisms through which instrumental behaviour can be selected and performed. Here we have used selective excitotoxic lesions to investigate the involvement of subnuclei of the amygdala as well as the core and shell regions of the nucleus accumbens on PIT in rats. Within the amygdala, selective lesions of the central nucleus (CeN), but not of the basolateral nucleus (BLA), abolished the PIT effect. In addition, selective lesions of the NAcc core, but not the NAcc shell, also abolished PIT. None of the lesions impaired the acquisition of Pavlovian food cup approaches or instrumental responding itself. These data demonstrate that the CeN and NAcc core are central components of the neural system mediating the impact of Pavlovian cues on instrumental responding. We suggest that this effect may depend upon the regulation of the dopaminergic innervation of the NAcc core by projections from the CeN to the ventral tegmental area.},

I argue that neural dysfunction is not sufficient for disease: something is a brain disease only when neural dysfunction is sufficient for impairment. I claim that the neural dysfunction that is characteristic of addiction is not sufficient for impairment, because people who suffer from that dysfunction are impaired, sufficiently to count as diseased, only given certain features of their context. Hence addiction is not a brain disease (though it is often a disease, and it may always involve brain dysfunction). I argue that accepting that addiction is not a brain disease does not entail a moralizing attitude toward people who suffer as a result of addiction; if anything, it allows for a more compassionate, and more effective, response to addiction.},

The claim that promotion of the BDMA is the only way the general public can be persuaded to withhold blame and punishment from addicts is critically examined. After a discussion of public understandings of the disease concept of addiction, it is pointed out that it is possible to develop a scientific account of addiction which is neither a disease nor a moral model but which the public could understand. Evidence is reviewed to suggest that public acceptance of the disease concept is largely lip-service and that the claim the BDMA removes stigma among the public and professionals is unsupported by evidence. Further, there is good evidence that biogenetic explanations of mental/behavioural disorders in general have been counterproductive in the attempt to ally stigma. A model of addiction as a disorder of choice may attract special problems in public-facing communications and risks being misunderstood. However, ways of presenting this model to the public are suggested that may avoid such risks. Lastly, the claim that the BDMA is the only way of ensuring access to treatment and of maintaining research funding for addiction is disputed and a way in which these benefits can be retained under a disorder-of-choice model proposed. The article concludes by enthusiastically endorsing Lewis’ call for a third stage in the governing image of addiction.},

Previous microarray studies identified individual genes as candidates for alcohol phenotypes, but efforts to generate an integrated view of molecular and cellular changes underlying alcohol addiction are lacking. Here, we applied a novel systems approach to transcriptome profiling in postmortem human brains and generated a systemic view of brain alterations associated with alcohol abuse. We identified critical cellular components and previously unrecognized epigenetic determinants of gene coexpression relationships and discovered novel markers of chromatin modifications in alcoholic brain. Higher expression levels of endogenous retroviruses and genes with high GC content in alcoholics were associated with DNA hypomethylation and increased histone H3K4 trimethylation, suggesting a critical role of epigenetic mechanisms in alcohol addiction. Analysis of cell-type-specific transcriptomes revealed remarkable consistency between molecular profiles and cellular abnormalities in alcoholic brain. Based on evidence from this study and others, we generated a systems hypothesis for the central role of chromatin modifications in alcohol dependence that integrates epigenetic regulation of gene expression with pathophysiological and neuroadaptive changes in alcoholic brain. Our results offer implications for epigenetic therapeutics in alcohol and drug addiction.},

Addiction is a complex psychiatric disorder considered to be a disease of the brain's natural reward reinforcement system. Repeated stimulation of the `reward' pathway leads to adaptive changes in gene expression and synaptic organization that reinforce drug taking and underlie long-term changes in behaviour. The primitive nature of reward reinforcement pathways and the near universal ability of abused drugs to target the same system allow drug-associated reward and reinforcement to be studied in non-mammalian species. Zebrafish have proved to be a valuable model system for the study of vertebrate development and disease. Here we demonstrate that adult zebrafish show a dose-dependent acute conditioned place preference (CPP) reinforcement response to ethanol or nicotine. Repeated exposure of adult zebrafish to either nicotine or ethanol leads to a robust CPP response that persists following 3 weeks of abstinence and in the face of adverse stimuli, a behavioural indicator of the establishment of dependence. Microarray analysis using whole brain samples from drug-treated and control zebrafish identified 1362 genes that show a significant change in expression between control and treated individuals. Of these genes, 153 are common to both ethanol- and nicotine-treated animals. These genes include members of pathways and processes implicated in drug dependence in mammalian models, revealing conservation of neuro-adaptation pathways between zebrafish and mammals.},

Based upon the United States National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) conducted in 2000–2002, the risk of experiencing drug dependence problems was robustly greater for adolescent recent-onset users of cocaine, psychostimulant drugs other than cocaine, analgesics, anxiolytic medicines, inhalants drugs, and cannabis, as compared to adult recent-onset users (odds ratio=1.5{\textasciitilde}4.3, p{\textless}0.05). This was not the case for the NSDUH hallucinogens group (e.g., LSD). The adolescent onset associated excess risk was not constant across all clinical features.

In recent years, proteomics technology has been widely used to assess the protein expression in the brain tissues of both animals and humans exposed to addictive drugs. Through this approach, a large number of proteins potentially involved in the etiology of drug addictions have been identified, which provide a valuable resource to study protein function, biochemical pathways, and networks related to the molecular mechanisms underlying drug dependence. In this article, we summarize the recent application of proteomics to profiling protein expression patterns in animal or human brain tissues after the administration of alcohol, amphetamine/methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, morphine/heroin/butorphanol, or nicotine. From available reports, we compiled a list of 497 proteins associated with exposure to one or more addictive drugs, with 160 being related to exposure to at least two abused drugs. A number of biochemical pathways and biological processes appear to be enriched among these proteins, including synaptic transmission and signaling pathways related to neuronal functions. The data included in this work provide a summary and extension of the proteomics studies on drug addiction. Furthermore, the proteins and biological processes highlighted here may provide valuable insight into the cellular activities and biological processes in neurons in the development of drug addiction.},

A series of population-based and epidemiological studies have identified specific stressors and individual-level variables that are predictive of substance use and abuse.

The deleterious effects of early life stress, child maltreatment, and accumulated adversity on alterations in the corticotropin releasing factor and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (CRF/HPA), the extrahypothalamic CRF, the autonomic arousal, and the central noradrenergic systems are also presented. The effects of these alterations on the corticostriatal-limbic motivational, learning, and adaptation systems that include mesolimbic dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) pathways are discussed as the underlying pathophysiology associated with stress-related risk of addiction. The effects of regular and chronic drug use on alterations in these stress and motivational systems are also reviewed, with specific attention to the impact of these adaptations on stress regulation, impulse control, and perpetuation of compulsive drug seeking and relapse susceptibility. Finally, research gaps in furthering our understanding of the association between stress and addiction are presented, with the hope that addressing these unanswered questions will significantly influence new prevention and treatment strategies to address vulnerability to addiction.},

To clarify the role of genetic and environmental risk factors in alcohol use disorders (AUDs), we performed a meta-analysis of twin and adoption studies and explored the impact of sex, assessment method (interview v. hospital/population records), and study design (twin v. adoption study) on heritability estimates.

Method
The literature was searched for all unique twin and adoption studies of AUD and identified 12 twin and five adoption studies. The data were then reconstructed and analyzed using ordinal data full information maximum likelihood in the OpenMx program. Heterogeneity was tested with likelihood ratio tests by equating the parameters across studies.

Results
There was no evidence for heterogeneity by study design, sex or assessment method. The best-fit estimate of the heritability of AUD was 0.49 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.43–0.53], and the proportion of shared environmental variance was 0.10 (95\% CI 0.03–0.16). Estimates of unique environmental proportions of variance differed significantly across studies.

Conclusions
AUD is approximately 50\% heritable. The multiple genetically informative studies of this syndrome have produced consistent results that support the validity of this heritability estimate, especially given the different potential methodological weaknesses of twin and adoption designs, and of assessments of AUD based on personal interviews v. official records. We also found evidence for modest shared environmental effects suggesting that environmental factors also contribute to the familial aggregation of AUDs.},

	abstract = {The question of addiction concerns the process by which drug-taking behavior, in certain individuals, evolves into compulsive patterns of drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior that take place at the expense of most other activities, and the inability to cease drug-taking, that is, the problem of relapse. In this paper we summarize one view of this process, the “incentive-sensitization” view, which we rst proposed in 1993. Four major tenets of the incentive-sensitization view are discussed. These are: (1) potentially addictive drugs share the ability to alter brain organization; (2) the brain systems that are altered include those normally involved in the process of incentive motivation and reward; (3) the critical neuroadaptations for addiction render these brain reward systems hypersensitive (“sensitized”) to drugs and drug-associated stimuli; and (4) the brain systems that are sensitized do not mediate the pleasurable or euphoric effects of drugs (drug “liking”), but instead they mediate a subcomponent of reward we have termed incentive salience (drug “wanting”).},

In turn, medical approaches to prevention and treatment are lacking. We examined evidence that drug (including alcohol) dependence is a chronic medical illness. A literature review compared the diagnoses, heritability, etiology (genetic and environmental factors), pathophysiology, and response to treatments (adherence and relapse) of drug dependence vs type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. Genetic heritability, personal choice, and environmental factors are comparably involved in the etiology and course of all of these disorders. Drug dependence produces significant and lasting changes in brain chemistry and function. Effective medications are available for treating nicotine, alcohol, and opiate dependence but not stimulant or marijuana dependence. Medication adherence and relapse rates are similar across these illnesses. Drug dependence generally has been treated as if it were an acute illness. Review results suggest that long-term care strategies of medication management and continued monitoring produce lasting benefits. Drug dependence should be insured, treated, and evaluated like other chronic illnesses.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the evolution of ideas about narcotic addiction. In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, addiction was not viewed as a medical condition, but as a ' bad habit '. The contemporary reaction to De Quincey's Confessions (1821) demonstrates the general lack of medical involvement. The question of opium eating and longevity, first generated by the Mar case, brought increased medical interest and an embryo connection with the anti-opium crusade. In the second half of the century, addiction was more fully 'medicalised' through the profession's involvement in the question of hypodermic morphine and the allied development of a disease theory of addiction. The ' problem ' of hypodermic morphine owed much to medical perceptions; and the disease theory, too, was not scientifically autonomous. Medical thinking developed in close alliance with moral biases, temperance and anti-opium beliefs. Treatment structures and methods were elaborated in line with increased medical interest. In the early twentieth century there was a distinct move on the part of the government, and the Home Office in particular, to defeat the ' disease ' view, and to substitute a penal policy. The 1926 Rolleston Report marked not simply a reassertion of the earlier moral-cure-medical emphasis, but a recognition of partnership between doctors and the state in which the limited nature of narcotic addiction at first ensured a liberal reaction.},

	abstract = {Within drug policy scholarship there is a growing body of literature applying ideational and social constructionist approaches to address the complexity of drug policy making and the apparent failure of the evidence-based policy paradigm to free the process from controversy and contestation. Ideational approaches are concerned with the roles played by ideas and beliefs in policy making, while social construction explores the way policy problems are constructed, and agendas are set and delineated by dominant frames and narratives. Interest in these approaches has developed over the last two decades, but has rapidly gained momentum over the last ﬁve years. There has been limited reﬂection on the state of the ﬁeld, therefore it is timely to conduct a review of the literature to assess the value of these approaches, capture emerging themes and issues, and identify gaps in the literature to support future research directions. Using the Arksey and O’Malley framework, a scoping review was conducted to survey the breadth of the ﬁeld. Following database and hand searching, 48 studies from 1996 to 2016 were selected for inclusion in the review. A narrative synthesis was undertaken and the literature was grouped into ﬁve broad theoretical approaches: ideational policy theory, problem construction, narratives and frames (including media analysis), construction of target populations, and policy transfer and mobilities. The majority of the studies are focused on single countries and drug policy issues, with few studies undertaking comparative work or reﬂecting on general theoretical developments in the literature. This study found that the Arksey and O’Malley framework was effective in capturing a potentially diverse ﬁeld of literature and demonstrates the importance of ideational and social constructionist approaches to drug policy scholarship. Further research is required to achieve expanded geographic coverage, test policy making models and undertake comparative work.},

The objective of this study was to distinguish between the family environment and genetic factors as the source of this observed family resemblance. Data were collected by telephone interview from members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, comprising male twin pairs who served in the U.S. military between 1965 and 1975. There were 3,372 pairs in which both twins participated. Drug use disorder was defined as receiving a diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence according to DSM-III-R; 10.1\% of the sample had abused or been dependent on at least one illicit drug. A significant difference between concordance rates for monozygotic (26.2\%) vs. dizygotic (16.5\%) twins indicated a genetic influence on drug use disorder. Biometrical modeling indicated that genetic factors (34\% of the variance), the environment shared by twins (28\% of the variance), and the nonshared environment (38\% of the variance) had significant influences of similar magnitudes on the individual's risk of developing a drug use disorder. These results support the application of molecular genetic approaches to elucidate the genetic influence on drug use disorder, as well as the potential efficacy of environmental intervention to reduce risk. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Various values of amplitude, stimulus component size and sample size are applied in order to examine the eﬀect of stimulus to the identiﬁcation process.

	abstract = {Theories of neural coding seek to explain how states of the world are mapped onto states of the brain. Here, we compare how an animal's location in space can be encoded by two different kinds of brain states: population vectors stored by patterns of neural firing rates, versus synchronization vectors stored by patterns of synchrony among neural oscillators. It has previously been shown that a population code stored by spatially tuned ‘grid cells’ can exhibit desirable properties such as high storage capacity and strong fault tolerance; here it is shown that similar properties are attainable with a synchronization code stored by rhythmically bursting ‘theta cells’ that lack spatial tuning. Simulations of a ring attractor network composed from theta cells suggest how a synchronization code might be implemented using fewer neurons and synapses than a population code with similar storage capacity. It is conjectured that reciprocal connections between grid and theta cells might control phase noise to correct two kinds of errors that can arise in the code: path integration and teleportation errors. Based upon these analyses, it is proposed that a primary function of spatially tuned neurons might be to couple the phases of neural oscillators in a manner that allows them to encode spatial locations as patterns of neural synchrony.},

	abstract = {As a rat navigates through a familiar environment, its position in space is encoded by firing rates of place cells and grid cells. Oscillatory interference models propose that this positional firing rate code is derived from a phase code, which stores the rat's position as a pattern of phase angles between velocity-modulated theta oscillations. Here we describe a three-stage network model, which formalizes the computational steps that are necessary for converting phase-coded position signals (represented by theta oscillations) into rate-coded position signals (represented by grid cells and place cells). The first stage of the model proposes that the phase-coded position signal is stored and updated by a bank of ring attractors, like those that have previously been hypothesized to perform angular path integration in the head-direction cell system. We show analytically how ring attractors can serve as central pattern generators for producing velocity-modulated theta oscillations, and we propose that such ring attractors may reside in subcortical areas where hippocampal theta rhythm is known to originate. In the second stage of the model, grid fields are formed by oscillatory interference between theta cells residing in different (but not the same) ring attractors. The model's third stage assumes that hippocampal neurons generate Gaussian place fields by computing weighted sums of inputs from a basis set of many grid fields. Here we show that under this assumption, the spatial frequency spectrum of the Gaussian place field defines the vertex spacings of grid cells that must provide input to the place cell. This analysis generates a testable prediction that grid cells with large vertex spacings should send projections to the entire hippocampus, whereas grid cells with smaller vertex spacings may project more selectively to the dorsal hippocampus, where place fields are smallest. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The septal theta rhythm (6-10 Hz) organizes the spatial activity of place and grid cells in time, but it remains unclear how spatial reference points organize the temporal activity of theta cells in space. We study spatial theta cells in simulations and single-unit recordings from exploring rats to ask whether temporal phase codes may anchor spatial representations to the outside world. We theorize that an experience-independent mechanism for temporal coding may combine with burst synchronization to continuously calibrate self-motion to allocentric reference frames. Subcortical recordings revealed spatial theta cells with strong rate-phase correlations related to distinct theta phases. Simulations of bursting neurons and networks explained that relationship and, with competitive learning, demonstrated flexible spatial synchronization patterns when driven by low-dimensional spatial components from the recording data. Thus temporal coding synchrony may reconcile extrinsic and intrinsic neural codes.},

	abstract = {Path integration is an evolutionarily conserved navigation strategy in which an organism updates an internal estimate of its position relative to the external world by integrating over time a movement vector representing distance and direction traveled. Accurate path integration requires a finely tuned gain factor that relates the animal's self movement to the updating of position on the internal "cognitive map", with external landmarks necessary to correct positional error that eventually accumulates. Path-integration-based models of hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells treat the path integration gain as a constant, but behavioral evidence in humans suggests that the gain is modifiable. Here we show physiological evidence from hippocampal place cells that the path integration gain is indeed a highly plastic variable that can be altered by continuous conflict between self-motion cues and feedback from external landmarks. In a novel, augmented reality system, visual landmarks were moved in proportion to the animal's movement on a circular track, creating continuous conflict with path integration. Sustained exposure to this cue conflict resulted in predictable and sustained recalibration of the path integration gain, as estimated from the place cells after the landmarks were extinguished. We propose that this rapid plasticity keeps the positional update in register with the animal's movement in the external world over behavioral timescales (mean 50 laps over 35 minutes). These results also demonstrate that visual landmarks not only provide a signal to correct cumulative error in the path integration system, as has been previously shown, but also rapidly fine-tune the integration computation itself.},

Unilateral anterior thalamic lesions produced evidence of a widespread hippocampal hypoactivity, as there were significant reductions in Fos counts in a range of regions within the ipsilateral hippocampal formation (rostral CA1, rostral dentate gyrus, ‘dorsal’ hippocampus, presubiculum and postsubiculum). A decrease in Fos levels was also found in the rostral and caudal retrosplenial cortex but not in the parahippocampal cortices or anterior cingulate cortices. The Fos changes seem most closely linked to sites that are also required for successful task performance, supporting the notion that the anterior thalamus, retrosplenial cortex and hippocampus form key components of an interdependent neuronal network involved in spatial mnemonic processing.},

Improving the performance of neural decoding algorithms allows us to better understand the information contained in a neural population, and can help advance engineering applications such as brain machine interfaces. Here, we apply modern machine learning techniques, including neural networks and gradient boosting, to decode from spiking activity in 1) motor cortex, 2) somatosensory cortex, and 3) hippocampus. We compare the predictive ability of these modern methods with traditional decoding methods such as Wiener and Kalman filters. Modern methods, in particular neural networks and ensembles, significantly outperformed the traditional approaches. For instance, for all of the three brain areas, an LSTM decoder explained over 40\% of the unexplained variance from a Wiener filter. These results suggest that modern machine learning techniques should become the standard methodology for neural decoding. We provide a tutorial and code to facilitate wider implementation of these methods.},

	abstract = {Head direction (HD) neurons fire selectively according to head orientation in the yaw plane relative to environmental landmark cues. Head movements provoke optic field flow signals that enter the vestibular nuclei, indicating head velocity, and hence angular displacements. To test whether optic field flow alone affects the directional firing of HD neurons, rats walked about on a circular platform as a spot array was projected onto the surrounding floor-to-ceiling cylindrical black curtain. Directional responses in the anterodorsal thalamus of four rats remained stable as they moved about with the point field but in the absence of landmark cues. Then, the spherical projector was rotated about its yaw axis at 4.5°/s for ∼90 s. In 27 sessions the mean drift speed of the preferred directions (PDs) was 1.48°/s (SD=0.78°/s; range: 0.15 to 2.88°/s). Thus, optic flow stimulation entrained PDs, albeit at drift speeds slower than the field rotation. This could be due to conflicts with vestibular, motor command, and efferent copy signals. After field rotation ended, 20/27 PDs drifted back to within 45° of the initial values over several minutes, generally following the shortest path to return to the initial value. Poststimulation drifts could change speed and/or direction, with mean speeds of 0.68±0.64°/s (range 0 to 1.36°/s). Since the HD cell pathway (containing anterodorsal thalamus) is the only known projection of head direction information to entorhinal grid cells and hippocampal place cells, yaw plane optic flow signals likely influence representations in this spatial reference coordinate system for orientation and navigation.},

The present study compared the ipsilateral thalamic-cortical connections with the corresponding crossed, contralateral connections between these same sets of regions. All efferents from the anteromedial thalamic nucleus to the cortex, as well as those to the subiculum, remained ipsilateral. In contrast, all of these target sites provided reciprocal, bilateral projections to the anteromedial nucleus. While the anteroventral thalamic nucleus often shared this same asymmetric pattern of cortical connections, it received relatively fewer crossed inputs than the anteromedial nucleus. This difference was most marked for the anterior cingulate projections, as those to the anteroventral nucleus remained almost entirely ipsilateral. Unlike the anteromedial nucleus, the anteroventral nucleus also appeared to provide a restricted, crossed projection to the contralateral retrosplenial cortex. Meanwhile, the closely related laterodorsal thalamic nucleus had almost exclusively ipsilateral efferent and afferent cortical connections. Likewise, within the hippocampus, the postsubiculum seemingly had only ipsilateral efferent and afferent connections with the anterior thalamic and laterodorsal nuclei. While the bilateral cortical projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei originated predominantly from layer VI, the accompanying sparse projections from layer V largely gave rise to ipsilateral thalamic inputs. In testing a potentially unifying principle of anterior thalamic – cortical interactions, a slightly more individual pattern emerged that reinforces other evidence of functional differences within the anterior thalamic and also helps to explain the consequences of unilateral interventions involving these nuclei.},

Using an object-place paired-associate task, we investigated changes in neural firing patterns in the hippocampus in association with a shift in strategy during learning. We used an object-place paired-associate task in which a pair of objects was presented in two different arms of a radial maze. Each object was associated with reward only in one of the arms, thus requiring the rats to consider both object identity and its location in the maze. Hippocampal neurons recorded in CA1 displayed a dynamic transition in their firing patterns during the acquisition of the task across days, and this corresponded to a shift in strategy manifested in behavioral data. Specifically, before the rats learned the task, they chose an object that maintained a particular egocentric relationship with their body (response strategy) irrespective of the object identity. However, as the animal acquired the task, it chose an object according to both its identity and the associated location in the maze (object-in-place strategy). We report that CA1 neurons in the hippocampus changed their prospective firing correlates according to the dominant strategy (i.e., response versus object-in-place strategy) employed at a given stage of learning.

	abstract = {A variety of setups and paradigms are used in the neurosciences for automatically tracking the location of an animal in an experiment and for extracting features of interest out of it. Many of these features, however, are critically sensitive to the unavoidable noise and artifacts of tracking. Here, we examine the relevant properties of several smoothing methods and suggest a combination of methods for retrieving locations and velocities and recognizing arrests from time series of coordinates of an animal’s center of gravity. We accomplish these by using robust nonparametric methods, such as Running Median (RM) and locally weighted regression methods. The smoothed data may, subsequently, be segmented to obtain discrete behavioral units with proven ethological relevance. New parameters such as the length, duration, maximal speed, and acceleration of these units provide a wealth of measures for, e.g., mouse behavioral phenotyping, studies on spatial orientation in vertebrates and invertebrates, and studies on rodent hippocampal function. This methodology may have implications for many tests of spatial behavior.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that disproportionately impacts memory and the hippocampus. However, it is unclear how AD pathology influences the activity of surviving neurons in the hippocampus to contribute to the memory symptoms in AD. One well-understood connection between spatial memory and neuronal activity in healthy brains is the activity of place cells, neurons in the hippocampus that fire preferentially in a specific location of a given environment (the place field of the place cell). In the present study, place cells were recorded from the hippocampus in a recently-developed rat model of AD (Tg-F344 AD) at an age (12-20 months) at which the AD rats showed marked spatial memory deficits. Place cells in the CA2 and CA3 pyramidal regions of the hippocampus in AD rats showed sharply reduced spatial fidelity relative to wild-type (WT) rats. In contrast, spiking activity of place cells recorded in region CA1 in AD rats showed good spatial fidelity that was similar to CA1 place cells in WT rats. Oral administration of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist VU0364572 impacted place cell firing rates in CA1 and CA2/3 hippocampal regions, but did not improve the spatial fidelity of CA2/3 hippocampal place cells in AD rats. The results indicated that, to the extent the spatial memory impairment in AD rats was attributable to hippocampal dysfunction, the memory impairment was more attributable to dysfunction in hippocampal regions CA2 and CA3 rather than CA1.},

Here we show in a transgenic mouse model expressing mutant human tau predominantly in the EC that the formation of mature tangles in old mice was associated with excitatory cell loss and deﬁcits in grid cell function, including destabilized grid ﬁelds and reduced ﬁring rates, as well as altered network activity. Overt tau pathology in the aged mice was accompanied by spatial memory deﬁcits. Therefore, tau pathology initiated in the entorhinal cortex could lead to deﬁcits in grid cell ﬁring and underlie the deterioration of spatial cognition seen in human AD.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible and highly progressive neurodegenerative disease. Clinically, patients with AD display impairments in episodic and spatial memory. However, the underlying neuronal dysfunctions that result in these impairments remain poorly understood. The hippocampus is crucial for spatial and episodic memory, and thus we tested the hypothesis that abnormal neuronal representations of space in the hippocampus contribute to memory deﬁcits in AD. To test this hypothesis, we recorded spikes from place cells in hippocampal subﬁeld CA1, together with corresponding rhythmic activity in local ﬁeld potentials, in the 3xTg AD mouse model. We observed disturbances in place cell ﬁring patterns, many of which were consistent with place cell disturbances reported in other rodent models of AD. We found place cell representations of space to be unstable in 3xTg mice compared to control mice. Furthermore, coordination of place cell ﬁring by hippocampal rhythms was disrupted in 3xTg mice. Speciﬁcally, a smaller proportion of place cells from 3xTg mice were signiﬁcantly phase-locked to theta and slow gamma rhythms, and the theta and slow gamma phases at which spikes occurred were also altered. Remarkably, these disturbances were observed at an age before detectable Ab pathology had developed. Consistencies between these ﬁndings in 3xTg mice and previous ﬁndings from other AD models suggest that disturbances in place cell ﬁring and hippocampal rhythms are related to AD rather than reﬂecting peculiarities inherent to a particular transgenic model. Thus, disturbed rhythmic organization of place cell activity may contribute to unstable spatial representations, and related spatial memory deﬁcits, in AD. VC 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The pars centralis is reciprocally connected with the ipsilateral lateral mammillary and interpeduncular nuclei; these projections constitute the major afferent and efferent systems of the DTN.

In the 16 years since we last summarized the behavior of the premotor elements that control saccades, research has revealed shortcomings in previous formulations of the control mechanisms of the brainstem saccadic burst generator. Specifically, complexities in the eye movement plant, a more detailed knowledge of the behaviors of certain bursting neurons, and previously undiscovered anatomical connections have broadened our knowledge but have generated new questions that require rethinking previous concepts. Perhaps the most crucial revelations/insights have come from studies that have implicated the superior colliculus and the midline cerebellum as crucial elements of the burst generator. In summarizing these recent findings here, we have been led to conclude that the superior colliculus issues the saccadic command and receives feedback from the brainstem burst generators, but the feedback does not control saccade size. In addition, the midline cerebellum also contains a feedback path, but only as part of a more generalized circuit that serves multiple functions.},

	shorttitle = {Angular velocity and head direction signals recorded from the dorsal tegmental nucleus of gudden in the rat},
	abstract = {When a rat navigates through space, head direction (HD) cells provide an ongoing signal of the rat's directional heading. It is thought that these cells rely, in part, on angular path integration of the rat's head movements. This integration requires that the HD cell system receive information about angular head movements and that this information be combined with the current directional signal, to generate the next "predicted" direction. Recent data suggest that the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN) may play a critical role in helping to generate the HD cell signal. To test this, recordings were made from cells in the DTN in freely moving rats. The following cell types were found: (a) "classic" HD cells, (b) angular velocity cells, and (c) cells that fired as a function of both head direction and angular velocity. Thus, DTN cells exhibit firing characteristics that are critical to the neural circuit hypothesized for generation of the HD cell signal.},

	abstract = {The hippocampal formation is essential for forming declarative representations of the relationships among multiple stimuli. The rodent hippocampal formation, including the entorhinal cortex and subicular complex, is critical for spatial memory. Two classes of hippocampal neurons fire in relation to spatial features. Place cells collectively map spatial locations, with each cell firing only when the animal occupies that cell's “place field,” a particular subregion of the larger environment. Head direction (HD) cells encode directional heading, with each HD cell firing when the rat's head is oriented in that cell's particular “preferred firing direction.” Both landmarks and internal cues (e.g., vestibular, motor efference copy) influence place and HD cell activity. However, as is the case for navigation, landmarks are believed to exert greater influence over place and HD cell activity. Here we show that temporary inactivation of the vestibular system led to the disruption of location-specific firing in hippocampal place cells and direction-specific discharge of postsubicular HD cells, without altering motor function. Place and HD cell activity recovered over a time course similar to that of the restoration of vestibular function. These results indicate that vestibular signals provide an important influence over the expression of hippocampal spatial representations, and may explain the navigational deficits of humans with vestibular dysfunction.

This directional signal is thought to be generated, in part, by a dead-reckoning mechanism that uses angular motion information to constantly update the directional representation. This study investigated what kinds of angular motion information might be used for dead reckoning. Anterior thalamic head-direction cells were recorded from rats in a rotatable, cylindrical chamber, which could independently deliver visual motion cues and vestibular cues. Results suggest that both of these angular motion cues have an influence on head-direction cells and may thus be used for dead reckoning.

	abstract = {In order to navigate efficiently, animals can benefit from internal representations of their moment-tomoment orientation. Head-direction (HD) cells are neurons that discharge maximally when the head of a rat is oriented in a specific (“preferred”) direction in the horizontal plane, independently from position or ongoing behavior. This directional selectivity depends on environmental and inertial cues. However, the mechanisms by which these cues are integrated remain unknown. This study examines the relative influence of visual, inertial and substratal cues on the preferred directions of HD cells when cue conflicts are produced in the presence of the rats. Twenty-nine anterior dorsal thalamic (ATN) and 19 postsubicular (PoS) HD cells were recorded from 7 rats performing a foraging task in a cylinder (76 cm in diameter, 60 cm high) with a white card attached to its inner wall. Changes in preferred directions were measured after the wall or the floor of the cylinder was rotated separately or together in the same direction by 45°, 90° or 180°, either clockwise or counterclockwise. Linear regression analyses showed that the preferred directions of the HD cells in both structures shifted by ≈90\% of the angle of rotation of the wall, whether rotated alone or together with the floor (r2{\textgreater}0.87, P{\textless}0.001). Rotations of the floor alone did not trigger significant shifts in preferred directions. These results indicate that visual cues exerted a strong but incomplete control over the preferred directions of the neurons, while inertial cues had a small but significant influence, and substratal cues were of no consequence.},

	abstract = {The role of the vestibular system in acquisition and performance of a spatial navigation task was examined in rats. Male Long-Evans rats received sham or bilateral sodium arsanilate-induced vestibular lesions. After postoperative recovery, under partial water-deprivation, rats were trained (16 trials/day) to ﬁnd a water reward in one corner of a black square enclosure. A cue card ﬁxed to one wall of the enclosure served as a stable landmark cue. The orientation of the rat at the start of each trial was pseudo-randomized such that the task could not be solved by an egocentric response strategy. Rats with vestibular lesions acquired the task in fewer trials than the sham treated control rats. Vestibular lesions did not inﬂuence the motivation or motor function necessary to perform the task. Performance of sham rats was maintained during probe trials in which the cue card was removed from the enclosure, while lesioned rats were markedly impaired. Rotation of the cue card ( 9 90°) caused an equivalent shift in corner choice behavior of the lesioned rats. However, sham rats often disregarded the rotated cue card and made place responses. These results suggest that the vestibular lesions disrupt idiothetic navigation or path integration and render navigational behavior critically dependent upon external landmarks. These results are consistent with the navigational abilities of humans with bilateral vestibular dysfunction. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses4,5. The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20\% more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40\% more visual information than optimal linear decoding6. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.},

These sequences predict immediate future behavior, even in cases when the specific combination of start and goal locations is novel. These results suggest that hippocampal sequence events previously characterized in linearly constrained environments as ‘replay’ are also capable of supporting a goal-directed, trajectory-finding mechanism, which identifies important places and relevant behavioral paths, at specific times when memory retrieval is required, and in a manner which could be used to control subsequent navigational behavior.},

However, this ‘phase precession’ effect is less well characterized during foraging in two-dimensional open field environments. Here, we mapped runs through the firing fields onto a unit circle to pool data from multiple runs. We asked which of seven behavioural and physiological variables show the best circular–linear correlation with the theta phase of spikes from place cells in hippocampal area CA1 and from grid cells from superficial layers of medial entorhinal cortex. The best correlate was the distance to the firing field peak projected onto the animal's current running direction. This was significantly stronger than other correlates, such as instantaneous firing rate and time-in-field, but similar in strength to correlates with other measures of distance travelled through the firing field. Phase precession was stronger in place cells than grid cells overall, and robust phase precession was seen in traversals through firing field peripheries (although somewhat less than in traversals through the centre), consistent with phase coding of displacement along the current direction. This type of phase coding, of place field distance ahead of or behind the animal, may be useful for allowing calculation of goal directions during navigation.},

Although activity of HDC is influenced by various sensory signals and internally generated cues, lesion studies and some anatomical and physiological evidence suggest that vestibular inputs are critical for the maintenance of directional sensitivity of these cells. However, vestibular inputs must be transformed considerably in order to signal head direction, and the neuronal circuitry that accomplishes this signal processing has not been fully established. Furthermore, it is unclear why the removal of vestibular inputs abolishes the directional sensitivity of HDC, as visual and other sensory inputs and motor feedback signals strongly affect the firing of these neurons and would be expected to maintain their directional-related activity. Further physiological studies will be required to establish the role of vestibular system in producing HDC responses, and anatomical studies are needed to determine the neural circuitry that mediates vestibular influences on determination of head direction.},

To test this hypothesis, we made lesions of the SGN in rats and screened for HD cells in the anterodorsal thalamus. In animals with complete bilateral lesions, the overall number of HD cells was significantly reduced relative to control animals. In animals with unilateral lesions of the SGN, directional activity was present, but the preferred firing directions of these cells were unstable and less influenced by the rotation of an environmental landmark. In addition, we found that preferred directions displayed large directional shifts when animals foraged for food in a darkened environment and when they were navigating from a familiar environment to a novel one, suggesting that the SGN plays a critical role in projecting essential self-motion (idiothetic) information to the HD cell circuit.},

In particular, we discuss how these systems work together and provide evidence that they involve common mechanisms. We first consider the classic view of the head direction cell and results of recent experiments in rodents and primates indicating that inputs to these neurons encode multimodal information during self-motion, such as proprioceptive and motor efference copy signals, including gaze-related information. We also consider the paradox that, while the head-direction network is generally assumed to generate a fixed representation of perceived directional heading, this computation would need to be dynamically updated when the relationship between voluntary motor command and its sensory consequences changes. Such situations include navigation in virtual reality and head-restricted conditions, since the natural relationship between visual and extravisual cues is altered.},

We show how restraint-dependent strength of recurrent connections within the attractor can explain differences in head direction cell firing between free foraging and restrained passive rotation. We also summarize recent findings on how gravity influences azimuth coding, indicating that the velocity drive is not purely egocentric. Finally, we show that the internal compass may be three-dimensional and hypothesize that the additional vertical degrees of freedom use global allocentric gravity cues.},

	abstract = {The activity of some neurons in the lateral mammillary nucleus (LMN) of the rat corresponds with the animal’s current head direction (HD). HD cells have been studied extensively but the circuitry responsible for the generation and maintenance of the HD signal has not been established. The present study tested the hypothesis that a polysynaptic pathway connects the vestibular nuclei with the LMN via one or more relay nuclei. This circuitry could provide a substrate for the integration of sensory input necessary for HD cell activity. This hypothesis is based upon the prior demonstration that labyrinthectomy abolishes HD selectivity in thalamic neurons. Viral transneuronal tracing with pseudorabies virus (PRV) was used to test this hypothesis. We injected recombinants of PRV into the LMN and surrounding nuclei of adult male rats and defined the patterns of retrograde transneuronal infection at survival intervals of 60 and 72 h. Infected medial vestibular neurons (MVN) were only observed at the longest postinoculation interval in animals in which the injection site was localized largely to the LMN. Robust infection of the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN) and nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (PH) in these cases, but not in controls, at both survival intervals identified these nuclei as potential relays of vestibular input to the LMN. These data are consistent with the conclusion that vestibular information that contributes to the LMN HD cell activity is relayed to this caudal hypothalamic cell group via a polysynaptic brainstem circuit.},

	abstract = {The anteroventral thalamic nucleus (AV) has a role in spatial memory, but the influence of the prominent brainstem cholinergic projection to this region is unknown. Here, spatial memory in a 12-arm radial maze was examined after 0.15 μl bilateral AV infusions of scopolamine. In part one, rats visited six arms singly (the phase 1 arms) and, after a 10 min delay, were allowed free choice to both phase 1 arms and the remaining six baited arms (phase 2 arms). Scopolamine (10 μg) administered during the delay increased errors to both phase 1 and phase 2 arms, whereas PBS infusions increased phase 1 arm errors only. The PBS effect was the result of inserting the internal cannulas alone and not the infusion. The same dose of scopolamine (10 μg) infused before maze testing (part two: no phase 1 arms, no delay) also impaired spatial memory over and above the effects of both PBS and no-infusion, which did not differ markedly. Part two also showed that choice latency and choice strategies were unaffected by PBS and scopolamine. Cannulation and infusion procedures in both parts one and two did not produce any negative carryover effects across multiple control (no internal cannula) sessions, and a trypan blue manipulation indicated that infusions were restricted to the AV region. This study provides the first direct evidence that the brainstem cholinergic innervation to the limbic thalamus influences learning and memory, which may have important implications for human neurological conditions such as alcohol-related disorders and schizophrenia.},

Recent work has addressed two issues. First, how can networks of neurons robustly hold such an active memory? Computer systems obtain significant robustness to noise by approximating analogue quantities with discrete digital representations. In a similar manner, theoretical models of persistent activity in spiking neurons have shown that the most robust and stable way to store the short-term memory of a continuous parameter is to approximate it with a discrete representation. This general idea applies very broadly to mechanisms that range from biochemical networks to single cells and to large circuits of neurons. Second, why is it commonly observed that persistent activity in the cortex can be strongly time-varying? This observation is almost ubiquitous, and therefore must be taken into account in our models and our understanding of how short-term memories are held in the cortex.},

Experimental evidence suggests that vestibular inputs are critical for the maintenance these cells' directional sensitivity. However, it is still unclear how vestibular information is conveyed to the HD cell-related circuitry. In a recent study, the supragenual nucleus (SG) was suggested as a putative relay of vestibular inputs to this circuitry. In the present study, using anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing methods, we first investigated whether the SG is in a position to convey vestibular inputs. Next, we examined the projections of the SG with the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin method. Our results indicate that the SG receives direct inputs from the medial vestibular nucleus and projects to elements of the HD cell-related circuitry, providing a massive input to the contralateral dorsal tegmental nucleus and a moderately dense projection to the shell region of the lateral mammillary nucleus. Overall, the present findings serve to clarify how vestibular inputs reach the HD cell-related circuit and point out the SG as an important interface to this end.},

Such models afford the mammillary bodies no independent role in memory and overlook the importance of their other, non-hippocampal, inputs. This review focuses on recent advances that herald a new understanding of the importance of the mammillary bodies, and their inputs from the limbic midbrain, for anterior thalamic function. It has become apparent that the mammillary bodies’ contribution to memory is not dependent on afferents from the subicular complex. Rather, the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden is a vital source of inputs that support memory processes within the medial mammillary bodies. In parallel, the lateral mammillary bodies, via their connections with the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden, are critical for generating head-direction signals. These two parallel, but distinct, information streams converge on the anterior thalamic nuclei and support different aspects of spatial memory.},

Second, the model functions without making physiologically unrealistic assumptions. In particular, it implements attractor dynamics in postsubiculum and lateral mammillary nucleus without directionally tuned inhibitory neurons, which have never been observed in vivo, and it integrates angular velocity without the use of multiplicative synapses. The model allows us to examine the relationships among three HD areas and various properties of their representations. A surprising result is that certain combinations of purported HD cell properties are mutually incompatible, suggesting that the lateral mammillary nucleus may not be the primary source of head direction input to anterior thalamic HD cells.},

	abstract = {The subicular complex, including the prosubiculum (ProS), subiculum (Sub), presubiculum, postsubiculum (PoS), and parasubiculum (PaS), plays important roles in the medial temporal memory system and is heavily involved in many neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. In the literature, the ProS (in primate) and PoS (in rodent) are inconstantly identified, making data comparison difficult across species. This review is an attempt to discuss equivalencies and extent of the five subicular components in human, monkey, and rodent based on available information on their cytoarchitecture, chemoarchitecture, molecular signature, and neural connectivity. All five subicular cortices exist in human, monkey, and rodent. In human and monkey, the ProS and Sub extend into the uncal region anteriorly, and the PoS and PaS reach the cingulate isthmus posteriorly. In rodent, most of the typical subicular cortices are located in the dorsal and caudal portions of the hippocampal formation, and the modified version of the ventral ProS and Sub corresponds to the modified description of the uncal ProS and Sub in monkey and human. An interesting triangular region in rodent located at the juncture of the PoS, PaS, retrosplenial cortex, and visual cortex appears to be the equivalent of the monkey area prostriata. Major connections of the five subicular cortices are also summarized based on unified criteria discussed in this review, with distinct connections revealed between the ProS and the Sub. J. Comp.

To determine how information about location, direction, and distance is integrated in the grid-cell network, we recorded from each principal cell layer of MEC in rats that explored two-dimensional environments. Whereas layer II was predominated by grid cells, grid cells colocalized with head-direction cells and conjunctive grid × head-direction cells in the deeper layers. All cell types were modulated by running speed. The conjunction of positional, directional, and translational information in a single MEC cell type may enable grid coordinates to be updated during self-motion–based navigation.

Most spikes from CS cells ocurred when the animal was located within a particular place on the maze and moving in a particular direction. Theta cells had very low spatial selectivity. Both cell categories had discharge probabilities which increased somewhat as a function of running velocity but tended to asymptote well before half-maximal velocity. The place/direction specificity of CS cells was significantly higher in CA1 than in CA3 and CA3 CS cells exhibited a striking preference for the inward radial direction. The pronounced directional selectivity of CS cells, at least in the present environment, suggests that they fire in response to complex, but specific, stimulus features in the extramaze world rather than to absolute place in a non-egocentric space. An alternative possibility is that the geometrical constraints of the maze surface have a profound influence on the shapes of the response fields of CS cells.},

Theoretical studies, in conjunction with recent empirical discoveries, suggest that the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) might perform some of the essential underlying computations by means of a unique, periodic synaptic matrix that could be self-organized in early development through a simple, symmetry-breaking operation. The scale at which space is represented increases systematically along the dorsoventral axis in both the hippocampus and the MEC, apparently because of systematic variation in the gain of a movement-speed signal. Convergence of spatially periodic input at multiple scales, from so-called grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, might result in non-periodic spatial firing patterns (place fields) in the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The human parahippocampal gyrus forms a large part of the limbic lobe along the ventromedial part of the temporal cortical mantle. It is a variable and complicated cortex in terms of structure, and the latter is aggravated further by interfaces with the anterior insula anteriorly and the cingulate gyrus and occipital lobe posteriorly. Additional complications relate to its lateral border with the temporal cortex and especially the sulcal configurations that define this junction. The rhinal sulcus, which separates parahippocampal and temporal cortices in other species, including the anthropoid apes, is either lacking or rudimentary in the human brain. Thus, defining this junction requires cytoarchitectural examination and precludes the use of mere inspection of sulcal existing patterns. The cortical areas that form the parahippocampal gyrus are vulnerable to pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its entorhinal and perirhinal subdivisions are both the most heavily damaged cortical areas and the focus for disease onset. The neurons that acquire neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) occupy the junction of the isocortical mantle with the limbic cortical mantle, but share, or partially share, a vulnerability phenotype with large neurons in both domains. The differential expression of this phenotype across time creates the false impression of NFT spread in cross-sectional comparisons of AD brains. The questions of what this phenotype is and why it is expressed first in the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices of the parahippocampal gyrus are the central molecular biological/neuroanatomical questions in understanding the etiology of AD.},

	abstract = {The number and topographic distribution of immunocytochemically stained parvalbumin interneurons was determined in the hippocampal formation of control and Alzheimer's diseased brain. In control hippocampus, parvalbumin interneurons were aspiny and pleomorphic, with extensive dendritic arbors. In dentate gyrus, parvalbumin cells, as well as a dense plexus of fibers and puncta, were associated with the granule cell layer. A few cells also occupied the molecular layer. In strata oriens and pyramidale of CA1–CA3 subfields, parvalbumin neurons gave rise to dendrites that extended into adjacent strata. Densely stained puncta and beaded fibers occupied stratum pyramidale, with less dense staining in adjacent strata oriens and radiatum. Virtually no parvalbumin profiles were observed in stratum lacunosum-moleculare or the alveus. Numerous polymorphic parvalbumin neurons and a dense plexus of fibers and puncta characterized the deep layer of the subiculum and the lamina principalis externa of the presubiculum. In Alzheimer's diseased hippocampus, there was an approximate 60\% decrease in the number of parvalbumin interneurons in the dentate gyrus/CA4 subfield (P{\textless}0.01) and subfields CA1–CA2 (P{\textless}0.01). In contrast, parvalbumin neurons did not statistically decline in subfields CA3, subiculum or presubiculum in Alzheimer's diseased brains relative to controls. Concurrent staining with Thioflavin-S histochemistry did not reveal degenerative changes within parvalbumin-stained profiles. These findings reveal that parvalbumin interneurons within specific hippocampal subfields are selectively vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease. This vulnerability may be related to their differential connectivity, e.g., those regions connectionally related to the cerebral cortex (dentate gyrus and CA1) are more vulnerable than those regions connectionally related to subcortical loci (subiculum and presubiculum).},

	abstract = {In the majority of affected brain regions the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits in the form of diffuse and neuritic plaques, tau pathology in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and plaque-associated abnormal neurites in combination with an inflammatory response. However, the anatomical area of the presubiculum, is characterised by the presence of a single large evenly distributed ‘lake-like’ Aβ deposit with minimal tau deposition or accumulation of inflammatory markers. Post-mortem brain samples from sporadic AD (SAD) and familial AD (FAD) and two hereditary cerebral amyloid diseases, familial British dementia (FBD) and familial Danish dementia (FDD) were used to compare the morphology of the extracellular proteins deposited in the presubiculum compared to the entorhinal cortex. The level of tau pathology and the extent of microglial activation were quantitated in the two brain regions in SAD and FAD. Frozen tissue was used to investigate the Aβ species and proteomic differences between the two regions. Consistent with our previous investigations of FBD and FDD cases we were able to establish that the ‘lake-like’ pre-amyloid deposits of the presubiculum were not a unique feature of AD but they also found two non-Aβ amyloidosis. Comparing the presubiculum to the entorhinal cortex the number of neurofibrillary tangles and tau load were significantly reduced; there was a reduction in microglial activation; there were differences in the Aβ profiles and the investigation of the whole proteome showed significant changes in different protein pathways. In summary, understanding why the presubiculum has a different morphological appearance, biochemical and proteomic makeup compared to surrounding brain regions severely affected by neurodegeneration could lead us to understanding protective mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases.},

This is commonly attributed to memory impairment, but it may reflect impaired spatial cognition. Methods: The authors examined the role of memory, perceptual, and cognitive mechanisms in spatial disorientation by comparing the performance of normal young (YN), middle-aged (MA), older adult (OA), and AD subjects on neuropsychological and spatial orientation tests. Results: The tendency to become lost is shared by almost all patients with AD (93\%) and some OA subjects (38\%). This impairment is not related to memory impairment. Instead, it reflects an inability to link recognized scenes with locations in the environment. Conclusions: Spatial disorientation reflects the impaired linking of landmarks and routes that should be assessed in conjunction with routine memory testing in elderly patients.},

The rat limbic system contains head direction (HD) cells that fire according to heading in the horizontal plane, and these cells are thought to provide animals with an internal compass. Previous work has found that HD cell tuning correlates with behavior on navigational tasks, but a direct, causal link between HD cells and navigation has not been demonstrated. Here, we show that pathway-specific optogenetic inhibition of the nucleus prepositus caused HD cells to become directionally unstable under dark conditions without affecting the animals’ locomotion. Then, using the same technique, we found that this decoupling of the HD signal in the absence of visual cues caused the animals to make directional homing errors and that the magnitude and direction of these errors were in a range that corresponded to the degree of instability observed in the HD signal. These results provide evidence that the HD signal plays a causal role as a neural compass in navigation.},

	abstract = {Navigation first requires accurate perception of one's spatial orientation within the environment, which consists of knowledge about location and directional heading. Cells within several limbic system areas of the mammalian brain discharge allocentrically as a function of the animal's directional heading, independent of the animal's location and ongoing behavior. These cells are referred to as head direction (HD) cells and are believed to encode the animal's perceived directional heading with respect to its environment. Although HD cells are found in several areas, the principal circuit for generating this signal originates in the dorsal tegmental nucleus and projects serially, with some reciprocal connections, to the lateral mammillary nucleus → anterodorsal thalamus → PoS, and terminates in the entorhinal cortex. HD cells receive multimodal information about landmarks and self-generated movements. Vestibular information appears critical for generating the directional signal, but motor/proprioceptive and landmark information are important for updating it.},

We describe the cytoarchitecture of the presubicular six-layered cortex and the morphological and electrophysiological intrinsic properties of principal neurons and interneurons. While the presubicular head direction signal depends on synaptic input from thalamus, the intra- and interlaminar information flow in the microcircuit of the presubiculum may contribute to refine directional tuning.

It shares functional similarities with the hippocampus, including the presence of place ﬁelds and lesion-induced impairments in spatial navigation, and the RSC is an important source of visual-spatial input to the hippocampus. Recently, the RSC has been the target of intense scrutiny among investigators of human memory and navigation. fMRI and lesion data suggest an RSC role in the ability to use landmarks to navigate to goal locations. However, no direct neurophysiological evidence of encoding navigational cues has been reported so the speciﬁc RSC contribution to spatial cognition has been uncertain. To examine this, we trained rats on a T-maze task in which the reward location was explicitly cued by a ﬂashing light and we recorded RSC neurons as the rats learned. We found that RSC neurons rapidly encoded the light cue. Additionally, RSC neurons encoded the reward and its location, and they showed distinct ﬁring patterns along the left and right trajectories to the goal. These responses may provide key information for goal-directed navigation, and the loss of these signals may underlie navigational impairments in subjects with RSC damage.},

Two cortical regions that are connected to primary visual areas, postsubiculum (PoS) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), possess HD cells: we investigated whether they differ in how they process visual landmarks.
Methods: We compared PoS and RSC HD cell activity from tetrode-implanted rats exploring an arena in which correct HD orientation required discrimination of two opposing landmarks having high, moderate or low discriminability.
Results: RSC HD cells had higher firing rates than PoS HD cells and slightly lower modulation by angular head velocity, and anticipated actual head direction by {\textasciitilde}48 ms, indicating that RSC spiking leads PoS spiking. Otherwise, we saw no differences in landmark processing, in that HD cells in both regions showed equal responsiveness to and discrimination of the cues, with cells in both regions having unipolar directional tuning curves and showing better discrimination of the highly discriminable cues. There was a small spatial component to the signal in some cells, consistent with their role in interacting with the place cell navigation system, and there was also slight modulation by running speed. Neither region showed theta modulation of HD cell spiking.
Conclusions: That the cells can immediately respond to subtle differences in spatial landmarks is consistent with rapid processing of visual snapshots or scenes; similarities in PoS and RSC responding may be due either to similar computations being performed on the visual inputs, or to rapid sharing of information between these regions. More generally, this two-cue HD cell paradigm may be a useful method for testing rapid spontaneous visual discrimination capabilities in other experimental settings.},

Chen, L. H. Lin, E. J. Green, C. A. Barnes, \& B. L. McNaughton, 1994), the authors found head direction cells with properties similar to those in other areas. These cells were slightly anticipatory. Another cell type fired to particular combinations of location, direction, and movement, which suggested that they may fire whenever the rat approaches a particular location, using a particular locomotor behavior. The remaining cells could not be clearly categorized but also showed a significant correlation with one or more of the spatial–movement variables examined.

Quick and efficient traversal of learned routes is critical to the survival of many animals. Routes can be defined by both the ordering of navigational epochs, such as continued forward motion or execution of a turn, and the distances separating them. The neural substrates conferring the ability to fluidly traverse complex routes are not well understood, but likely entail interactions between frontal, parietal, and rhinal cortices and the hippocampus. This paper demonstrates that posterior parietal cortical neurons map both individual and multiple navigational epochs with respect to their order in a route. In direct contrast to spatial firing patterns of hippocampal neurons, parietal neurons discharged in a place- and direction-independent fashion. Parietal route maps were scalable and versatile in that they were independent of the size and spatial configuration of navigational epochs. The results provide a framework in which to consider parietal function in spatial cognition.},

	abstract = {The high density of the androgen receptors in fundamental centers of learning and memory, such as hippocampus, shows that there must be some relationships between the androgen receptors and cognitive aspects. To determine the role of hippocampal androgen receptors in spatial learning, the current research has been conducted to assess the effect of testosterone enanthate, as the agonist, and ﬂutamide, as the antagonist, of these receptors on spatial discrimination of rats, using the Morris water maze (MWM). Adult male rats were bilaterally cannulated into the CA1 region of their hippocampus. Different groups received different doses of ﬂutamide (2, 5, 10 and 20 mg / 0.5 ml) or testosterone enanthate (20, 40 and 80 mg / 0.5 ml) through the cannulas 30 min before training for 3 days. The results showed dose-dependent increases in latencies and traveled distances to ﬁnd the invisible platform both in ﬂutamide- and testosteronetreated groups as compared to the control group, with peak effects at doses of 5 mg / 0.5 ml for ﬂutamide and 80 mg / 0.5 ml for testosterone. Therefore, it seems that both androgen receptor blockade and exogenous testosterone can effect spatial localization of adult, male rats. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

As transformative technologies such as DREADDs are introduced, applied, and refined, their utility in addressing complex questions about behavior and cognition becomes clear and exciting. In the behavioral neuroscience field, remarkable new findings now regularly appear as a result of the ability to monitor and intervene in neural processes with high anatomical precision as animals behave in complex task environments. As these new tools are applied to behavioral questions, individualized procedures for their use find their way into diverse labs. Thus, “tips of the trade” become important for wide dissemination not only for laboratories that are using the tools but also for those who are interested in incorporating them into their own work.

	abstract = {Background
In addition to cognitive deficits, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with other neuropsychiatric symptoms, including severe depression. Indeed, depression often precedes cognitive deficits in patients with AD. Unfortunately, the field has seen only minimal therapeutic advances, underscoring the critical need for new treatments. P7C3 aminopropyl carbazoles promote neuronal survival by enhancing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide flux in injured neurons. Neuroprotection with P7C3 compounds has been demonstrated in preclinical models of neurodegeneration by virtue of promoting neuronal survival independently of early disease-specific pathology, resulting in protection from cognitive deficits and depressive-like behavior. We hypothesize that P7C3 compounds might be uniquely applicable to patients with AD, given the comorbid presentation of depression and cognitive deficits.
Methods
Aging male and female wild-type and TgF344-AD rats, a well-characterized preclinical AD model, were administered (−)-P7C3-S243 daily for 9 and 18 months, beginning at 6 months of age. Behavioral phenotypes related to cognition and depression were assessed at 15 and 24 months, and brain pathology and biochemistry were assessed at 24 months.
Results
(−)-P7C3-S243 safely protected aging male and female wild-type and TgF344-AD rats from cognitive deficits and depressive-like behavior. Depressive-like behavior occurred earlier than cognitive deficits in TgF344-AD rats, consistent with AD in many patients. Treatment with (−)-P7C3-S243 blocked neurodegeneration in TgF344-AD rats, without altering amyloid deposition or indicators of neuroinflammation.
Conclusions
Neuronal cell death–specific treatment approaches, such as P7C3 compounds, may represent a new treatment approach for patients experiencing the combination of cognitive deficits and depression associated with AD.},

an animal’s directional heading and location in an environment. Within
this navigation system are head direction (HD) cells, which discharge as a
function of an animal’s directional heading, providing an animal with a
neural compass to guide ongoing spatial behavior. Experiments were designed to
test this hypothesis by damaging the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN), a mid-brain
structure that plays a critical role in the generation of the rodent HD cell
signal, and evaluating landmark based navigation using variants of the Morris
water task. In Experiments 1 and 2, shams and DTN lesioned rats were trained to
navigate toward a cued platform in the presence of a constellation of distal
landmarks located outside the pool. After reaching a training criteria, rats
were tested in three probe trials in which 1) the cued platform was completely
removed from the pool, 2) the pool was repositioned and the cued platform
remained in the same absolute location with respect to distal landmarks, or 3)
the pool was repositioned and the cued platform remained in the same relative
location in the pool. In general, DTN-lesioned rats required more training
trials to reach performance criterion, were less accurate to navigate to the
platform position when it was removed, and navigated directly to the cued
platform regardless of its position in the pool, indicating a general absence of
control over navigation by distal landmarks. In Experiment 3, DTN and control
rats were trained in directional and place navigation variants of the water task
where the pool was repositioned for each training trial and a hidden platform
was placed either in the same relative location (direction) in the pool or in
the same absolute location (place) in the distal room reference frame.
DTN-lesioned rats were initially impaired in the direction task, but ultimately
performed as well as controls. In the place task, DTN-lesioned rats were
severely impaired and displayed little evidence of improvement over the course
of training. Together, these results support the conclusion that the DTN is
required for accurate landmark navigation.},

We begin by reviewing evidence from anatomical studies and electrophysiological recordings which suggest that at least one of the functions of the anterior thalamus is to guide spatial orientation in relation to a global or distal spatial framework, while the lateral thalamus serves to guide behavior in relation to a local or proximal framework. We conclude by reviewing experimental work using targeted manipulations (lesion or neuronal silencing) of thalamic nuclei during spatial behavior and single-unit recordings from neuronal representations of space. Our summary of this literature suggests that although the evidence strongly supports a working model of spatial information processing involving the anterior thalamus, research regarding the role of the lateral thalamus is limited and requires further attention. We therefore identify a number of major gaps in this research and suggest avenues of future study that could potentially solidify our understanding of the relative roles of anterior and lateral thalamic regions in spatial representation and memory.},

In beacon navigation, animals reach goals using cues directly associated with them, whereas in landmark navigation animals use external cues to determine a direction and distance to goals. Path integration refers to the use of self-movement cues to obtain a trajectory to a goal. IPN-lesioned rats were tested in a food-carrying task in which they searched for food in an open field, and returned to a refuge after finding the food. Landmark navigation was evaluated during trials performed under lighted conditions and path integration was tested under darkened conditions, thus eliminating external cues. We report that IPN lesions increased the number of errors and reduced heading accuracy under both lighted and darkened conditions. Tests using a Morris water maze procedure indicated that IPN lesions produced moderate impairments in the landmark version of the water task, but left beacon navigation intact. These findings suggest that the IPN plays a fundamental role in landmark navigation and path integration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {It is widely assumed that incipient protein pathology in the medial temporal lobe instigates the loss of episodic memory in Alzheimer’s disease, one of the earliest cognitive deficits in this type of dementia. Within this region, the hippocampus is seen as the most vital for episodic memory. Consequently, research into the causes of memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease continues to centre on hippocampal dysfunction and how disease-modifying therapies in this region can potentially alleviate memory symptomology. The present review questions this entrenched notion by bringing together findings from post-mortem studies, non-invasive imaging (including studies of presymptomatic, at-risk cases) and genetically modified animal models. The combined evidence indicates that the loss of episodic memory in early Alzheimer’s disease reflects much wider neurodegeneration in an extended mnemonic system (Papez circuit), which critically involves the limbic thalamus. Within this system, the anterior thalamic nuclei are prominent, both for their vital contributions to episodic memory and for how these same nuclei appear vulnerable in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. As thalamic abnormalities occur in some of the earliest stages of the disease, the idea that such changes are merely secondary to medial temporal lobe dysfunctions is challenged. This alternate view is further strengthened by the interdependent relationship between the anterior thalamic nuclei and retrosplenial cortex, given how dysfunctions in the latter cortical area provide some of the earliest in vivo imaging evidence of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. Appreciating the importance of the anterior thalamic nuclei for memory and attention provides a more balanced understanding of Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, this refocus on the limbic thalamus, as well as the rest of Papez circuit, would have significant implications for the diagnostics, modelling, and experimental treatment of cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease.},

This has led to the hypothesis that NMDA receptors, through their involvement in LTP, may be necessary for spatial4–11 and other forms of learning12,13. We examined this hypothesis using NPC17742 (2R,4R,5S-2-amino-4,5-(l,2-cyclo hexyl)-7-phosphonoheptano acid), a potent and specific antagonist of NMDA receptors14–17. Here we report that NPC17742 completely blocked dentate gyrus LTP but did not prevent normal spatial learning in rats that had been made familiar with the general task requirements by non-spatial pretraining. Although these results do not rule out a contribution of NMDA-mediated dentate LTP to spatial learning, they indicate that this form of LTP is not required for normal spatial learning in the watermaze.},

Behavioral disturbances included thigmotaxic swimming, swimming over and deflecting off the platform, abnormal swim behavior, and hyperactivity. Rats familiar with the behavioral strategies involved in the task performed normally under NPC17742 or scopolamine. The results indicated that drug-induced sensorimotor disturbances contributed to poor acquisition scores in naive rats. NMDA or muscarinic activity may contribute to but do not appear to be essential for spatial learning in the water maze. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Most behavioral learning in biology is trial and error, but how these learning processes are influenced by individual brain systems is poorly understood. Here we show that ventral-to-dorsal hippocampal subdivisions have specific and sequential functions in trial-and-error maze navigation, with ventral hippocampus (vH) mediating early task-specific goal-oriented searching. Although performance and strategy deployment progressed continuously at the population level, individual mice showed discrete learning phases, each characterized by particular search habits. Transitions in learning phases reflected feedforward inhibitory connectivity (FFI) growth occurring sequentially in ventral, then intermediate, then dorsal hippocampal subdivisions. FFI growth at vH occurred abruptly upon behavioral learning of goal-task relationships. vH lesions or the absence of vH FFI growth delayed early learning and disrupted performance consistency. Intermediate hippocampus lesions impaired intermediate place learning, whereas dorsal hippocampus lesions specifically disrupted late spatial learning. Trial-and-error navigational learning processes in naive mice thus involve a stereotype sequence of increasingly precise subtasks learned through distinct hippocampal subdivisions. Because of its unique connectivity, vH may relate specific goals to internal states in learning under healthy and pathological conditions.},

In beacon navigation, animals reach goals using cues directly associated with them, whereas in landmark navigation animals use external cues to determine a direction and distance to goals. Path integration refers to the use of self-movement cues to obtain a trajectory to a goal. IPN-lesioned rats were tested in a food-carrying task where they searched for food in an open-field, and returned to a refuge after finding the food. Landmark navigation was evaluated during trials performed under lighted conditions and path integration was tested under darkened conditions, thus eliminating external cues. We report that IPN lesions increased the number of errors and reduced heading accuracy under both lighted and darkened conditions. Tests using a Morris water maze procedure indicated that IPN lesions produced moderate impairments in the landmark version of the water task, but left beacon navigation intact. These findings suggest that the IPN plays a fundamental role in landmark navigation and path integration.},

	abstract = {Abstract— The deposition of the amyloid β protein (Aβ) is a histopathologic hallmark of AD. The regions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are hierarchically involved in Aβ-deposition. To clarify whether there is a hierarchical involvement of the regions of the entire brain as well and whether there are differences in the expansion of Aβ-pathology between clinically proven AD cases and nondemented cases with AD-related pathology, the authors investigated 47 brains from demented and nondemented patients with AD-related pathology covering all phases of β-amyloidosis in the MTL (AβMTL phases) and four control brains without any AD-related pathology. Aβ deposits were detected by the use of the Campbell-Switzer silver technique and by immunohistochemistry in sections covering all brain regions and brainstem nuclei. It was analyzed how often distinct regions exhibited Aβ deposits. In the first of five phases in the evolution of β-amyloidosis Aβ deposits are found exclusively in the neocortex. The second phase is characterized by the additional involvement of allocortical brain regions. In phase 3, diencephalic nuclei, the striatum, and the cholinergic nuclei of the basal forebrain exhibit Aβ deposits as well. Several brainstem nuclei become additionally involved in phase 4. Phase 5, finally, is characterized by cerebellar Aβ-deposition. The 17 clinically proven AD cases exhibit Aβ-phases 3, 4, or 5. The nine nondemented cases with AD-related Aβ pathology show Aβ-phases 1, 2, or 3. Aβ-deposition in the entire brain follows a distinct sequence in which the regions are hierarchically involved. Aβ-deposition, thereby, expands anterogradely into regions that receive neuronal projections from regions already exhibiting Aβ. There are also indications that clinically proven AD cases with full-blown β-amyloidosis may be preceded in early stages by nondemented cases exhibiting AD-related Aβ pathology.},

	abstract = {Spatial disorientation is a prominent feature of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) attributed to degeneration of medial temporal and parietal brain regions, including the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). By contrast, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes show generally intact spatial orientation at presentation. However, currently no clinical tasks are routinely administered to objectively assess spatial orientation in these neurodegenerative conditions. In this study we investigated spatial orientation in 58 dementia patients and 23 healthy controls using a novel virtual supermarket task as well as voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We compared performance on this task with visual and verbal memory function, which has traditionally been used to discriminate between AD and FTD. Participants viewed a series of videos from a first person perspective travelling through a virtual supermarket and were required to maintain orientation to a starting location. Analyses revealed significantly impaired spatial orientation in AD, compared to FTD patient groups. Spatial orientation performance was found to discriminate AD and FTD patient groups to a very high degree at presentation. More importantly, integrity of the RSC was identified as a key neural correlate of orientation performance. These findings confirm the notion that i) it is feasible to assess spatial orientation objectively via our novel Supermarket task; ii) impaired orientation is a prominent feature that can be applied clinically to discriminate between AD and FTD and iii) the RSC emerges as a critical biomarker to assess spatial orientation deficits in these neurodegenerative conditions.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology begins decades prior to onset of clinical symptoms, and the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus are among the first and most extensively impacted brain regions. The TgF344-AD rat model, which more fully recapitulates human AD pathology in an age-dependent manner, is a next generation preclinical rodent model for understanding pathophysiological processes underlying the earliest stages of AD (Cohen et al., 2013). Whether synaptic alterations occur in hippocampus prior to reported learning and memory deficit is not known. Furthermore, it is not known if specific hippocampal synapses are differentially affected by progressing AD pathology, or if synaptic deficits begin to appear at the same age in males and females in this preclinical model. Here, we investigated the time-course of synaptic changes in basal transmission, paired-pulse ratio, as an indirect measure of presynaptic release probability, long-term potentiation (LTP), and dendritic spine density at two hippocampal synapses in male and ovariectomized female TgF344-AD rats and wildtype littermates, prior to reported behavioral deficits. Decreased basal synaptic transmission begins at medial perforant path-dentate granule cell (MPP-DGC) synapses prior to Schaffer-collateral-CA1 (CA3-CA1) synapses, in the absence of a change in paired-pulse ratio (PPR) or dendritic spine density. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent LTP magnitude is unaffected at CA3-CA1 synapses at 6, 9, and 12months of age, but is significantly increased at MPP-DGC synapses in TgF344-AD rats at 6months only. Sex differences were only observed at CA3-CA1 synapses where the decrease in basal transmission occurs at a younger age in males versus females. These are the first studies to define presymptomatic alterations in hippocampal synaptic transmission in the TgF344-AD rat model. The time course of altered synaptic transmission mimics the spread of pathology through hippocampus in human AD and provides support for this model as a valuable preclinical tool in elucidating pathological mechanisms of early synapse dysfunction in AD.},

Little is known, however, about the information represented in these nuclei. To redress this deficit, we recorded units in three rostral thalamic nuclei in freely-moving rats (the parataenial nucleus, the anteromedial nucleus and nucleus reuniens). We found units in these nuclei possessing previously unsuspected spatial properties. The various cell types show clear similarities to place cells, head direction cells, and perimeter/border cells described in hippocampal and parahippocampal regions. Based on their connectivity, it had been predicted that the anterior thalamic nuclei process information with high spatial and temporal resolution while the midline nuclei have more diffuse roles in attention and arousal. Our current findings strongly support the first prediction but directly challenge or substantially moderate the second prediction. The rostral thalamic spatial cells described here may reflect direct hippocampal/parahippocampal inputs, a striking finding of itself, given the relative lack of place cells in other sites receiving direct hippocampal formation inputs. Alternatively, they may provide elemental thalamic spatial inputs to assist hippocampal spatial computations. Finally, they could represent a parallel spatial system in the brain.},

Here, we compare how an animal's location in space can be encoded by two different kinds of brain states: population vectors stored by patterns of neural firing rates, versus synchronization vectors stored by patterns of synchrony among neural oscillators. It has previously been shown that a population code stored by spatially tuned ‘grid cells’ can exhibit desirable properties such as high storage capacity and strong fault tolerance; here it is shown that similar properties are attainable with a synchronization code stored by rhythmically bursting ‘theta cells’ that lack spatial tuning. Simulations of a ring attractor network composed from theta cells suggest how a synchronization code might be implemented using fewer neurons and synapses than a population code with similar storage capacity. It is conjectured that reciprocal connections between grid and theta cells might control phase noise to correct two kinds of errors that can arise in the code: path integration and teleportation errors. Based upon these analyses, it is proposed that a primary function of spatially tuned neurons might be to couple the phases of neural oscillators in a manner that allows them to encode spatial locations as patterns of neural synchrony.},

	abstract = {A number of studies have examined the theta-rhythmic modulation of neuronal firing in the hippocampal circuit. For extracellular recordings, this is often done by examining spectral properties of the spike-time autocorrelogram, most significantly, for validating the presence or absence of theta modulation across species. These techniques can show significant rhythmicity for high firing rate, highly rhythmic neurons; however, they are substantially biased by several factors including the peak firing rate of the neuron, the amount of time spent in the neuron’s receptive field, and other temporal properties of the rhythmicity such as cycle-skipping. These limitations make it difficult to examine rhythmic modulation in neurons with low firing rates or when an animal has short dwell times within the firing field and difficult to compare rhythmicity under disparate experimental conditions when these factors frequently differ. Here, we describe in detail the challenges that researchers face when using these techniques and apply our findings to recent recordings from bat entorhinal grid cells, suggesting that they may have lacked enough data to examine theta rhythmicity robustly. We describe a more sensitive and statistically rigorous method using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of a parametric model of the lags within the autocorrelation window, which helps to alleviate some of the problems of traditional methods, which was also unable to detect rhythmicity in bat grid cells. Using large batteries of simulated data, we explored the boundaries for which the MLE technique and the theta index can detect rhythmicity. The MLE technique is less sensitive to many features of the autocorrelogram, and provides a framework for statistical testing to detect rhythmicity as well as changes in rhythmicity in individual sessions providing a substantial improvement over previous methods.},

	abstract = {The spatial firing pattern of entorhinal grid cells may be important for navigation. Many different computational models of grid cell firing use path integration based on movement direction and the associated movement speed to drive grid cells. However, the response of neurons to movement direction has rarely been tested, in contrast to multiple studies showing responses of neurons to head direction. Here, we analyzed the difference between head direction and movement direction during rat movement and analyzed cells recorded from entorhinal cortex for their tuning to movement direction. During foraging behavior, movement direction differs significantly from head direction. The analysis of neuron responses shows that only 5 out of 758 medial entorhinal cells show significant coding for both movement direction and head direction when evaluating periods of rat behavior with speeds above 10cm/s and ±30° angular difference between movement and head direction. None of the cells coded movement direction alone. In contrast, 21 cells in this population coded only head direction during behavioral epochs with these constraints, indicating much stronger coding of head direction in this population. This suggests that the movement direction signal required by most grid cell models may arise from other brain structures than the medial entorhinal cortex.

	abstract = {Head direction (HD) cells in the rat limbic system carry information about the direction the head is pointing in the horizontal plane. Most previous studies of HD functioning have used animals locomoting in an upright position or ascending/descending a vertical wall. In the present study, we recorded HD cell activity from the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus while the animal was locomoting in an upside-down orientation. Rats performed a shuttle-box task requiring them to climb a vertical wall and locomote across the ceiling of the apparatus while inverted to reach an adjoining wall before ascending into the reward compartment. The apparatus was oriented toward the preferred direction of the recorded cell, or the 180 degrees opposite direction. When the animal was traversing the vertical walls of the apparatus, the HD cells remained directionally tuned as if the walls were an extension of the floor. When the animal was locomoting inverted on the ceiling, however, cells showed a dramatic change in activity. Nearly one-half (47\%) of the recorded cells exhibited no directional specificity during inverted locomotion, despite showing robust directional tuning on the walls before and after inversion. The remaining cells showed significantly degraded measures of directional tuning and random shifts of the preferred direction relative to the floor condition while the animal was inverted. It has previously been suggested that the HD system uses head angular velocity signals from the vestibular system to maintain a consistent representation of allocentric direction. These findings suggest that being in an inverted position causes a distortion of the vestibular signal controlling the HD system.},

A central tenet of systems neuroscience is that the mammalian hippocampus provides a cognitive map of the environment. This view is supported by the finding of place cells, neurons whose firing is tuned to specific locations in an animal’s environment, within this brain region. Recent work, however, has shown that these cells repeat their firing fields across visually identical maze compartments [1, 2]. This repetition is not observed if these compartments face different directions, suggesting that place cells use a directional input to differentiate otherwise similar local environments [3, 4]. A clear candidate for this input is the head direction cell system. To test this, we disrupted the head direction cell system by lesioning the lateral mammillary nuclei and then recorded place cells as rats explored multiple, connected compartments, oriented in the same or in different directions. As shown previously, we found that place cells in control animals exhibited repeated fields in compartments arranged in parallel, but not in compartments facing different directions. In contrast, the place cells of animals with lesions of the head direction cell system exhibited repeating fields in both conditions. Thus, directional information provided by the head direction cell system appears essential for the angular disambiguation by place cells of visually identical compartments.},

Persistent head direction signals are transmitted from anterior thalamus to the presubiculum, but the identity of the presubicular target neurons, their connectivity and function in local microcircuits are unknown. Here, we examine how thalamic afferents recruit presubicular principal neurons and Martinotti interneurons, and the ensuing synaptic interactions between these cells. Pyramidal neuron activation of Martinotti cells in superficial layers is strongly facilitating such that high-frequency head directional stimulation efficiently unmutes synaptic excitation. Martinotti-cell feedback plays a dual role: precisely timed spikes may not inhibit the firing of in-tune head direction cells, while exerting lateral inhibition. Autonomous attractor dynamics emerge from a modelled network implementing wiring motifs and timing sensitive synaptic interactions in the pyramidal—Martinotti-cell feedback loop. This inhibitory microcircuit is therefore tuned to refine and maintain head direction information in the presubiculum.},

	abstract = {Summary
When a navigator’s internal sense of direction is disrupted, she must rely on external cues to regain her bearings, a process termed spatial reorientation. Extensive research has demonstrated that the geometric shape of the environment exerts powerful control over reorientation behavior, but the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood. Whereas some theories claim that geometry controls behavior through an allocentric mechanism potentially tied to the hippocampus, others postulate that disoriented navigators reach their goals by using an egocentric view-matching strategy. To resolve this debate, we characterized hippocampal representations during reorientation. We first recorded from CA1 cells as disoriented mice foraged in chambers of various shapes. We found that the alignment of the recovered hippocampal map was determined by the geometry of the chamber, but not by nongeometric cues, even when these cues could be used to disambiguate geometric ambiguities. We then recorded hippocampal activity as disoriented mice performed a classical goal-directed spatial memory task in a rectangular chamber. Again, we found that the recovered hippocampal map aligned solely to the chamber geometry. Critically, we also found a strong correspondence between the hippocampal map alignment and the animal’s behavior, making it possible to predict the search location of the animal from neural responses on a trial-by-trial basis. Together, these results demonstrate that spatial reorientation involves the alignment of the hippocampal map to local geometry. We hypothesize that geometry may be an especially salient cue for reorientation because it is an inherently stable aspect of the environment.},

	abstract = {Summary
Goal-directed behavior can be affected by environmental geometry. A classic example is the rectangular arena reorientation task, where subjects commonly confuse opposite but geometrically identical corners [1]. Until recently, little was known about how environmental geometry shapes spatial representations in a neurobehavioral context [2] (although see [3]). In the present study, we asked: Under what circumstances does the internal cognitive map predict behavior? And when does it fail to do so? To this end, we developed a variant of the classical reorientation task that allows for investigation of temporal dynamics of reorientation. We recorded head-direction (HD) cells and grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of rats before, during, and after performing the task. MEC cells showed a bimodal response of being either aligned or rotated, relative to the free-foraging open-field sessions. Alignment was remarkably stable between disorientations and indicative of corner choice as a function of current and past alignment of spatial representations. Accordingly, when the cells showed consistent and properly aligned readout across multiple trials, behavioral choices were better predicted by HD and grid cell readout, with a probability of more than 70\%. This was not the case when the cells did not show a stable consistent readout. Our findings indicate that entorhinal spatial representations predict corner choice, contingent on the stability and reliability of their readout. This work sets the stage for further studies on the link between the reliability of the neuronal signal and behavior, with implications for many brain systems in many organisms.},

Indeed, escape latency is the main, and often unique, performance measure used for the quantification of behavior. Aim of the present work was to overcome this limitation by presenting a methodology that allows for automatic categorical pattern recognition of the behavioral strategies performed in the MWM. By selecting few a priori and user-defined behavioral categories, many quantitative variables and regions of interest (ROIs), we used discriminant analysis (DA) to obtain 97.9\% of correct automatic recognition of categories. The developed discriminant model (DM) also allowed to predict category membership of newly recorded swim paths with the same statistical efficacy (96\%), and to identify the variables that better discriminate between adjacent categories. The combination of DA with a tracking system, a selection of many variables, different ROIs and qualitative categorization, reduces the gap between the measurement process and the categories used to describe a given behavior, and offers a methodology to computationally reproduce the human categorization of behaviors in the MWM.},

Activation of hM4D signaling sharply reduced synaptic release probability and synaptic current amplitude. To demonstrate the utility of this tool for neural circuit perturbations, we developed an axon-selective hM4D–neurexin variant and used spatially targeted intracranial CNO injections to localize circuit connections from the hypothalamus to the midbrain responsible for feeding behavior. This synaptic silencing approach is broadly applicable for cell type-specific and axon projection-selective functional analysis of diverse neural circuits.},

Here we demonstrate that projections to VTA from rostral (RVP), but not caudal VP (CVP) are robustly Fos-activated during cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking—a rat model of relapse in addiction. Moreover, designer receptor-mediated transient inactivation of RVP neurons, their terminals in VTA, or functional connectivity between RVP and VTA dopamine neurons blocks the ability of drug-associated cues (but not a cocaine prime) to reinstate cocaine seeking. In contrast, CVP neuronal inhibition instead blocked cocaine-primed, but not cue-induced reinstatement. This novel double dissociation in VP sub-regional roles in drug seeking is likely important for understanding mesocorticolimbic circuits underlying reward seeking and addiction.},

	abstract = {The head direction (HD) circuit is a complex interconnected network of brain regions ranging from the brain stem to the cortex. Recent work found that HD cells corecorded ipsilaterally in the anterodorsal nucleus (ADN) of the thalamus displayed coordinated firing patterns. A high-frequency oscillation pattern (130-160 Hz) was visible in the cross-correlograms of these HD cell pairs. Spectral analysis further found that the power of this oscillation was greatest at 0 ms and decreased at greater lags, and demonstrated that there was greater synchrony between HD cells with similar preferred firing directions. Here, we demonstrate that the same high-frequency synchrony exists in HD cell pairs recorded contralaterally from one another in the bilateral ADN. When we examined the cross-correlograms of HD cells that were corecorded bilaterally, we observed the same high-frequency ({\textasciitilde}150- to 200-Hz) oscillatory relationship. The strength of this synchrony was similar to the synchrony seen in ipsilateral HD cell pairs, and the degree of synchrony in each cross-correlogram was dependent on the difference in tuning between the two cells. Additionally, the frequency rate of this oscillation appeared to be independent of the firing rates of the two cross-correlated cells. Taken together, these results imply that the left and right thalamic HD network are functionally related despite an absence of direct anatomical projections. However, anatomical tracing has found that each of the lateral mammillary nuclei (LMN) project bilaterally to both of the ADN, suggesting the LMN may be responsible for the functional connectivity observed between the two ADN.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This study used bilateral recording electrodes to examine whether head direction cells recorded simultaneously in both the left and right thalamus show coordinated firing. Cross-correlations of the cells' spike trains revealed a high-frequency oscillatory pattern similar to that seen in cross-correlations between pairs of ipsilateral head direction cells, demonstrating that the bilateral thalamic head direction signals may be part of a single unified network.},

By contrast, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes show generally intact spatial orientation at presentation. However, currently no clinical tasks are routinely administered to objectively assess spatial orientation in these neurodegenerative conditions. In this study we investigated spatial orientation in 58 dementia patients and 23 healthy controls using a novel virtual supermarket task as well as voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We compared performance on this task with visual and verbal memory function, which has traditionally been used to discriminate between AD and FTD. Participants viewed a series of videos from a first person perspective travelling through a virtual supermarket and were required to maintain orientation to a starting location. Analyses revealed significantly impaired spatial orientation in AD, compared to FTD patient groups. Spatial orientation performance was found to discriminate AD and FTD patient groups to a very high degree at presentation. More importantly, integrity of the RSC was identified as a key neural correlate of orientation performance. These findings confirm the notion that i) it is feasible to assess spatial orientation objectively via our novel Supermarket task; ii) impaired orientation is a prominent feature that can be applied clinically to discriminate between AD and FTD and iii) the RSC emerges as a critical biomarker to assess spatial orientation deficits in these neurodegenerative conditions.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that significant memory problems are not specific to Alzheimer's disease (AD) but can be also observed in other neurodegenerative conditions, such as behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). We investigated whether orientation (spatial \& temporal) information is a better diagnostic marker for AD compared to memory and whether their atrophy correlates of orientation and memory differ. A large sample (n = 190) of AD patients (n = 73), bvFTD patients (n = 54), and healthy controls (n = 63) underwent testing. A subset of the patients (n = 72) underwent structural imaging using voxel-based morphometry analysis of magnetic resonance brain imaging. Orientation and memory scores from the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination showed that AD patients had impaired orientation and memory, while bvFTD patients performing at control level for orientation but had impaired memory. A logistic regression showed that 78\% of patients could be classified on the basis of orientation and memory scores alone at clinic presentation. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was conducted using orientation and memory scores as covariates, which showed that the neural correlates for orientation and memory also dissociated with posterior hippocampus cortex being related to orientation in AD, while the anterior hippocampus was associated with memory performance in the AD and bvFTD patients. Orientation and memory measures discriminate AD and bvFTD to a high degree and tap into different hippocampal regions. Disorientation and posterior hippocampus appears therefore specific to AD and will allow clinicians to discriminate AD patients from other neurodegenerative conditions with similar memory deficits at clinic presentation.},

We have now examined the role of cognitive and perceptual mechanisms in the navigational impairment of AD to test the hypothesis that men and women with AD may focus on different navigational cues. We conducted navigational, neuropsychologic, and psychophysical testing in men and women from 3 groups: older normal controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with AD. Men and women showed parallel declines in navigational capacities from the older normal control, to the mild cognitive impairment, to the AD groups with men and women making similar numbers of errors but different types of errors. There were small sex differences in neuropsychologic and psychophysical performance but large sex differences in how those measures related to navigational capacity: men showed strong links between visual motion processing and navigation. Women showed strong links between verbal capacities and navigation. The findings of these cross-sectional comparisons suggest that there may be sex differences in the progressive navigational decline of AD: men and women who are impaired to the same degree may suffer somewhat different patterns of decline with men relying more on visuospatial processing and women relying more on verbal mediation.},

	abstract = {Background:
Older adults get lost, in many cases because of recognized or incipient Alzheimer disease (AD). In either case, getting lost can be a threat to individual and public safety, as well as to personal autonomy and quality of life. Here we compare our previously described real-world navigation test with a virtual reality (VR) version simulating the same navigational environment.

Methods:
Quantifying real-world navigational performance is difficult and time-consuming. VR testing is a promising alternative, but it has not been compared with closely corresponding real-world testing in aging and AD. We have studied navigation using both real-world and virtual environments in the same subjects: young normal controls (YNCs, n = 35), older normal controls (ONCs, n = 26), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 12), and patients with early AD (EAD, n = 14).

Results:
We found close correlations between real-world and virtual navigational deficits that increased across groups from YNC to ONC, to MCI, and to EAD. Analyses of subtest performance showed similar profiles of impairment in real-world and virtual testing in all four subject groups. The ONC, MCI, and EAD subjects all showed greatest difficulty in self-orientation and scene localization tests. MCI and EAD patients also showed impaired verbal recall about both test environments.

Conclusions:
Virtual environment testing provides a valid assessment of navigational skills. Aging and Alzheimer disease (AD) share the same patterns of difficulty in associating visual scenes and locations, which is complicated in AD by the accompanying loss of verbally mediated navigational capacities. We conclude that virtual navigation testing reveals deficits in aging and AD that are associated with potentially grave risks to our patients and the community.

	abstract = {Although the memory impairment is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), AD has also been characterized by spatial disorientation, which is present from its early stages. Spatial disorientation in AD manifests itself in getting lost in familiar and unfamiliar places and have been characterized more specifically using spatial navigation tests in both real space and virtual environments as an impairment in multiple spatial abilities, including allocentric and egocentric navigation strategies, visuo-spatial perception, or selection of relevant information for successful navigation. Patients suffering mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who are at a high risk of development of dementia, show impairment in a subset of these abilities, mainly connected with allocentric and egocentric processing. While spatial disorientation in typical AD patients probably reflects neurodegenerative changes in medial and posterior temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes, and retrosplenial cortex, the impairment of spatial navigation in MCI seem to be connected mainly with the medial temporal and also parietal brain changes. In this review, we will summarize the signs of brain disease in most MCI and AD patients showing in various tasks of spatial memory and navigation.},

	abstract = {The effect of APOE ε4 allele (ε4) on spatial navigation in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is unknown.
Our purpose was to examine the characteristics of spatial navigation impairment in ε4-positive (ε4+) and ε4-negative (ε4-) aMCI subgroups.
Blood samples were collected to determine the APOE genotype. A total of 34 aMCI patients were stratified into aMCI-ε4- (n = 23) and aMCI-ε4+ (n = 11) groups. Control (n = 28) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 16) groups were also used. We used a human analogue of the Morris water maze (enclosed arena 2.9 m in diameter) to examine body-centered (egocentric) and world-centered (allocentric) spatial navigation.
The aMCI-ε4+ group performed poorer on spatial navigation than the aMCI-ε4- group in both egocentric and allocentric tasks even though these 2 groups did not differ in global cognitive functioning or neuropsychological tests. The aMCI-ε4+ and mild AD groups performed similarly on all Morris Water Maze tasks and were outperformed by the aMCI-ε4- group, which also resembled the control group in performance on the egocentric tasks. The aMCI groups showed poor spatial navigation learning regardless of their ε4 positivity.
We found more profound deficits in spatial navigation in aMCI-ε4+ relative to aMCI-ε4- patients. The aMCI-ε4+ group resembled the mild AD group in spatial navigation performance. Although the ε4 genotype was indicative of spatial navigation performance, it was not indicative of the aMCI patients' ability to learn the tasks. Spatial navigation testing represents a promising area with respect to identifying individuals at higher risk for AD among the heterogeneous MCI population.},

This effort is guided by an appreciation of the models of normative way-finding offered by environmental psychology and recent neuroscience research. It is proposed that several varieties of topographical disorientation exist, resulting from damage to distinct neuroanatomical areas. The particular pattern of impairments that patients evidence is argued to be consonant with the known functions of these cortical regions and with recent neuroimaging results.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have observed profound deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and one-trial learning in offspring whose mothers drank moderate quantities of ethanol during pregnancy. In the present study, we examined the question of whether lower maternal blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) could produce functional deficits in offspring.
METHODS: Rat dams consumed either a 2\%, 3\%, or 5\% ethanol liquid diet throughout gestation. Three other groups of dams were pair-fed a 0\% ethanol liquid diet, and a seventh group consumed lab chow ad libitum. Adult offspring from each diet group were assigned either to studies of evoked [3H]-D-aspartate (D-ASP) release from hippocampal slices or spatial learning studies using the Morris Water Task.
RESULTS: Consumption of the 2\%, 3\%, and 5\% ethanol liquid diets produced mean peak maternal BECs of 7, 30 and 83 mg/dL, respectively. Consumption of these ethanol diets had no effect on offspring birthweight, litter size or neonatal mortality. Likewise, evoked D-ASP release from hippocampal slices and performance on a standard version of the Morris Water Task were not affected by prenatal ethanol exposure. By contrast, activity-dependent potentiation of evoked D-ASP release from slices and one-trial learning on a "moving platform" version of the Morris Water Task were markedly reduced in offspring whose mothers consumed the 5\% ethanol liquid diet. Intermediate deficits in these two parameters were observed in offspring from the 3\% ethanol diet group, whereas offspring from the 2\% ethanol diet group were not statistically different than controls.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the threshold for eliciting subtle, yet significant learning deficits in offspring prenatally exposed to ethanol is less than 30 mg/dL. This BEC is roughly equivalent to drinking 1 to 1.5 ounces of ethanol per day.},

Allocentric spatial memory is assessed by altering the viewpoint, colors and textures between the initially presented and target images., Allocentric spatial memory is a key function of the hippocampus, one of the earliest brain regions to be affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and impairment of hippocampal function predates the onset of dementia. It was hypothesized that performance on the 4MT would aid the diagnosis of predementia AD, which manifests clinically as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)., The 4MT was applied to patients with MCI, stratified further based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarker status (10 MCI biomarker positive, 9 MCI biomarker negative), and with mild AD dementia, as well as healthy controls. Comparator tests included tests of episodic memory and attention widely accepted as sensitive measures of early AD. Behavioral data were correlated with quantitative MRI measures of the hippocampus, precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus., 4MT scores were significantly different between the two MCI groups (p = 0.001), with a test score of ≤8/15 associated with 100\% sensitivity and 78\% specificity for the classification of MCI with positive AD biomarkers, i.e., predementia AD. 4MT test scores correlated with hippocampal volume (r = 0.42) and cortical thickness of the precuneus (r = 0.55)., In conclusion, the 4MT is effective in identifying the early stages of AD. The short duration, easy application and scoring, and favorable psychometric properties of the 4MT fulfil the need for a simple but accurate diagnostic test for predementia AD.},

However, with the singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing adeno-associated viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography to image the EGFP-labelled axons throughout the brain. This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational resource for structural and functional investigations into the neural circuits that support behavioural and cognitive processes in health and disease.},

	abstract = {The proposal that separate populations of subicular cells provide the direct hippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies and anterior thalamic nuclei was tested by placing two different fluorescent tracers in these two sites. In spite of varying the injection locations within the mammillary bodies and within the three principal anterior thalamic nuclei and the lateral dorsal thalamic nucleus, the overall pattern of results remained consistent. Neurons projecting to the thalamus were localised to the deepest cell populations within the subiculum while neurons projecting to the mammillary bodies consisted of more superficially placed pyramidal cells within the subiculum. Even when these two cell populations become more intermingled, e.g. in parts of the intermediate subiculum, almost no individual cells were found to project to both diencephalic targets. In adjacent limbic areas, i.e. the retrosplenial cortex, postsubiculum, and entorhinal cortex, populations of cells that project to the anterior thalamic nuclei and mammillary bodies were completely segregated. This segregated pattern included afferents to those nuclei comprising the head-direction system. The sole exception was a handful of double-labelled cells, mainly confined to the ventral subiculum, that were only found after pairs of injections in the anteromedial thalamic nucleus and mammillary bodies. The projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei also had a septal-temporal gradient with relatively fewer cells projecting from the ventral (temporal) subiculum. These limbic projections to the mammillary bodies and anterior thalamus comprise a circuit that is vital for memory, within which the two major components could convey parallel, independent information.},

The RSC is involved in a variety of cognitive tasks including memory, navigation, and prospective thinking, yet the exact role of the RSC and the functional differences between its subdivisions remain elusive.

	abstract = {Spatial cells in the hippocampal complex play a pivotal role in the navigation of an animal. Exact neural principles behind these spatial cell responses have not been completely unraveled yet. Here we present two models for spatial cells, namely the Velocity Driven Oscillatory Network (VDON) and Locomotor Driven Oscillatory Network. Both models have basically three stages in common such as direction encoding stage, path integration (PI) stage, and a stage of unsupervised learning of PI values. In the first model, the following three stages are implemented: head direction layer, frequency modulation by a layer of oscillatory neurons, and an unsupervised stage that extracts the principal components from the oscillator outputs. In the second model, a refined version of the first model, the stages are extraction of velocity representation from the locomotor input, frequency modulation by a layer of oscillators, and two cascaded unsupervised stages consisting of the lateral anti-hebbian network. The principal component stage of VDON exhibits grid cell-like spatially periodic responses including hexagonal firing fields. Locomotor Driven Oscillatory Network shows the emergence of spatially periodic grid cells and periodically active border-like cells in its lower layer; place cell responses are found in its higher layer. This model shows the inheritance of phase precession from grid cell to place cell in both one- and two-dimensional spaces. It also shows a novel result on the influence of locomotion rhythms on the grid cell activity. The study thus presents a comprehensive, unifying hierarchical model for hippocampal spatial cells.},

When animals move, activity is translated between grid cells in accordance with the animal’s displacement in the environment. For this translation to occur, grid cells must have continuous access to information about instantaneous running speed. However, a powerful entorhinal speed signal has not been identified. Here we show that running speed is represented in the firing rate of a ubiquitous but functionally dedicated population of entorhinal neurons distinct from other cell populations of the local circuit, such as grid, head-direction and border cells. These ‘speed cells’ are characterized by a context-invariant positive, linear response to running speed, and share with grid cells a prospective bias of ∼50–80 ms. Our observations point to speed cells as a key component of the dynamic representation of self-location in the medial entorhinal cortex.},

	abstract = {Head direction (HD) cells in the rat limbic system fire according to the animal's orientation independently of the animal's environmental location or behavior. These HD cells receive strong inputs from the vestibular system, among other areas, as evidenced by disruption of their directional firing after lesions or inactivation of vestibular inputs. Two brainstem nuclei, the supragenual nucleus (SGN) and nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH), are known to project to the HD network and are thought to be possible relays of vestibular information. Previous work has shown that lesioning the SGN leads to a loss of spatial tuning in downstream HD cells, but the NPH has historically been defined as an oculomotor nuclei and therefore its role in contributing to the HD signal is less clear. Here, we investigated this role by recording HD cells in the anterior thalamus after either neurotoxic or electrolytic lesions of the NPH. There was a total loss of direction-specific firing in anterodorsal thalamus cells in animals with complete NPH lesions. However, many cells were identified that fired in bursts unrelated to the animals' directional heading and were similar to cells seen in previous studies that damaged vestibular-associated areas. Some animals with significant but incomplete lesions of the NPH had HD cells that were stable under normal conditions, but were unstable under conditions designed to minimize the use of external cues. These results support the hypothesis that the NPH, beyond its traditional oculomotor function, plays a critical role in conveying vestibular-related information to the HD circuit.},

	abstract = {The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) occupies a central position within neural circuits devoted to the representation of spatial location and orientation. The MEC contains cells that fire as a function of the animal’s head direction (HD), as well as grid cells that fire in multiple locations in an environment, forming a repeating hexagonal pattern. The MEC receives inputs from widespread areas of the cortical mantle including the ventral visual stream, which processes object recognition information, as well as information about visual landmarks. The role of the MEC in processing the HD signal or landmark information is unclear. We addressed this issue by neurotoxically damaging the MEC and recording HD cells within the anterodorsal thalamus (ADN). Direction-specific activity was present in the ADN of all animals with MEC lesions. Moreover, the discharge characteristics of ADN HD cells were only mildly affected by MEC lesions, with HD cells exhibiting greater anticipation of future HDs. Tests of landmark control revealed that HD cells in lesioned rats were capable of accurately updating their preferred firing directions in relation to a salient visual cue. Furthermore, cells from lesioned animals maintained stable preferred firing directions when locomoting in darkness and demonstrated stable HD cell tuning when locomoting into a novel enclosure, suggesting that MEC lesions did not disrupt the integration of idiothetic cues, or angular path integration, by HD cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that the MEC plays a limited role in the formation and spatial updating of the HD cell signal.},

They are able to track head direction using only internally-derived information (path integration). In this simulation study we investigate the factors that affect path integration accuracy. Specifically, two major limiting factors are identified: rise time, the time after stimulation it takes for a neuron to start firing, and the presence of symmetric non-offset within-layer recurrent collateral connectivity. On the basis of the latter, the important prediction is made that head direction cell regions directly involved in path integration will not contain this type of connectivity; giving a theoretical explanation for architectural observations. Increased neuronal rise time is found to slow path integration, and the slowing effect for a given rise time is found to be more severe in the context of short conduction delays. Further work is suggested on the basis of our findings, which represent a valuable contribution to understanding of the head direction cell system.},

We propose a quantitative framework whereby this drive represents a multisensory self-motion estimate computed through an internal model that uses sensory prediction errors of vestibular, visual, and somatosensory cues to improve on-line motor drive. We show how restraint-dependent strength of recurrent connections within the attractor can explain differences in head direction cell firing between free foraging and restrained passive rotation. We also summarize recent findings on how gravity influences azimuth coding, indicating that the velocity drive is not purely egocentric. Finally, we show that the internal compass may be three-dimensional and hypothesize that the additional vertical degrees of freedom use global allocentric gravity cues.},

Persistent head direction signals are transmitted from anterior thalamus to the presubiculum, but the identity of the presubicular target neurons, their connectivity and function in local microcircuits are unknown. Here, we examine how thalamic afferents recruit presubicular principal neurons and Martinotti interneurons, and the ensuing synaptic interactions between these cells. Pyramidal neuron activation of Martinotti cells in superficial layers is strongly facilitating such that high-frequency head directional stimulation efficiently unmutes synaptic excitation. Martinotti-cell feedback plays a dual role: precisely timed spikes may not inhibit the firing of in-tune head direction cells, while exerting lateral inhibition. Autonomous attractor dynamics emerge from a modelled network implementing wiring motifs and timing sensitive synaptic interactions in the pyramidal—Martinotti-cell feedback loop. This inhibitory microcircuit is therefore tuned to refine and maintain head direction information in the presubiculum.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}During spatial navigation, the head orientation of an animal is encoded internally by neural persistent activity in the head-direction (HD) system. In computational models, such a bell-shaped “hill of activity” is commonly assumed to be generated by recurrent excitation in a continuous attractor network. Recent experimental evidence, however, indicates that HD signal in rodents originates in a reciprocal loop between the lateral mammillary nucleus (LMN) and the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN), which is characterized by a paucity of local excitatory axonal collaterals. Moreover, when the animal turns its head to a new direction, the heading information is updated by a time integration of angular head velocity (AHV) signals; the underlying mechanism remains unresolved. To investigate these issues, we built and investigated an LMN-DTN network model that consists of three populations of noisy and spiking neurons coupled by biophysically realistic synapses. We found that a combination of uniform external excitation and recurrent cross-inhibition can give rise to direction-selective persistent activity. The model reproduces the experimentally observed three types of HD tuning curves differentially modulated by AHV and anticipatory firing activity in LMN HD cells. Time integration is assessed by using constant or sinusoidal angular velocity stimuli, as well as naturalistic AHV inputs (from rodent recordings). Furthermore, the internal representation of head direction is shown to be calibrated or reset by strong external cues. We identify microcircuit properties that determine the ability of our model network to subserve time integration function.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Oscillatory interference models account for the spatial firing properties of grid cells in terms of neuronal oscillators with frequencies modulated by the animal's movement velocity. The phase of such a “velocity-controlled oscillator” (VCO) relative to a baseline (theta-band) oscillation tracks displacement along a preferred direction. Input from multiple VCOs with appropriate preferred directions causes a grid cell's grid-like firing pattern. However, accumulating phase noise causes the firing pattern to drift and become corrupted. Here we show how multiple redundant VCOs can automatically compensate for phase noise. By entraining the baseline frequency to the mean VCO frequency, VCO phases remain consistent, ensuring a coherent grid pattern and reducing its spatial drift. We show how the spatial stability of grid firing depends on the variability in VCO phases, e.g., a phase SD of 3 ms per 125 ms cycle results in stable grids for 1 min. Finally, coupling N VCOs with similar preferred directions as a ring attractor, so that their relative phases remain constant, produces grid cells with consistently offset grids, and reduces VCO phase variability of the order square root of N. The results suggest a viable functional organization of the grid cell network, and highlight the benefit of integrating displacement along multiple redundant directions for the purpose of path integration.},

Connection of appropriate speed- and direction-dependent inputs onto dendritic subunits could result from an unsupervised learning rule which maximizes postsynaptic firing (e.g. competitive learning). These inputs cause the intrinsic oscillation of subunit membrane potential to increase above theta frequency by an amount proportional to the animal's speed of running in the "preferred" direction. The phase difference between this oscillation and a somatic input at theta-frequency essentially integrates velocity so that the interference of the two oscillations reflects distance traveled in the preferred direction. The overall grid pattern is maintained in environmental location by phase reset of the grid cell by place cells receiving sensory input from the environment, and environmental boundaries in particular. We also outline possible variations on the basic model, including the generation of grid-like firing via the interaction of multiple cells rather than via multiple dendritic subunits. Predictions of the interference model are given for the frequency composition of EEG power spectra and temporal autocorrelograms of grid cell firing as functions of the speed and direction of running and the novelty of the environment.},

	abstract = {The anterior thalamic nuclei are assumed to support episodic memory with anterior thalamic dysfunction a core feature of diencephalic amnesia. To date, the electrophysiological characterization of this region in behaving rodents has been restricted to the anterodorsal nucleus. Here we compared single-unit spikes with population activity in the anteroventral nucleus (AV) of freely moving rats during foraging and during naturally occurring sleep. We identified AV units that synchronize their bursting activity in the 6–11 Hz range. We show for the first time in freely moving rats that a subgroup of AV neurons is strongly entrained by theta oscillations. This feature together with their firing properties and spike shape suggests they be classified as “theta” units. To prove the selectivity of AV theta cells for theta rhythm, we compared the relation of spiking rhythmicity to local field potentials during theta and non-theta periods. The most distinguishable non-theta oscillations in rodent anterior thalamus are sleep spindles. We therefore compared the firing properties of AV units during theta and spindle periods. We found that theta and spindle oscillations differ in their spatial distribution within AV, suggesting separate cellular sources for these oscillations. While theta-bursting neurons were related to the distribution of local field theta power, spindle amplitude was independent of the theta units' position. Slow- and fast-spiking bursting units that are selectively entrained to theta rhythm comprise 23.7\% of AV neurons. Our results provide a framework for electrophysiological classification of AV neurons as part of theta limbic circuitry.},

Lesions of vestibular hair cells disrupt the characteristic firing patterns of HD cells, and thus vestibular afference is a critical contributor to the HD signal. A subcortical pathway that may convey this information includes the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden (DTN) and the lateral mammillary nucleus (LMN). To test the hypothesis that the DTN and LMN are critical components for generating HD cell activity, we made electrolytic lesions of the DTN or LMN in rats and screened for HD cell activity in the anterior thalamus. Directional activity was absent in all animals with complete LMN lesions and in animals with complete DTN lesions, although a few HD cells were isolated in animals with incomplete lesions. Some DTN-lesioned animals contained cells whose firing rates were modulated by angular head velocity. Although cells with bursting patterns of activity have been observed in the anterior dorsal nucleus of the thalamus of animals with disruption of vestibular inputs, this pattern of activity was not observed in either the LMN- or DTN-lesioned animals. The general absence of direction-specific activity in the anterior thalamus of animals with DTN or LMN lesions is consistent with the view that the DTN–LMN circuit is essential for the generation of HD cell activity.},

This is especially the case in communication systems with amplitude or frequency modulation. These concepts are often introduced empirically. However, it is well known that the correct approach for this purpose is to use the concept of analytic signal. Starting from this point, we show some examples of contradictions appearing when using other deﬁnitions of instantaneous amplitude or frequency that are commonly admitted. This introduces the problem of characterizing pure amplitudemodulated or pure phase-modulated signals. It is especially shown that whereas amplitude modulated signals can be characterized by spectral considerations, this is no longer the case for phasemodulated signals. Furthermore, signals with constant amplitude have very speciﬁc properties, which are analyzed in detail. Some consequences and extensions to random signals are ﬁnally discussed.},

This ‘binding’ mechanism requires that spatially distributed cells fire together with millisecond range precision7,8; however, it is not clear how such coordinated timing is achieved given that the frequency of gamma oscillations varies substantially across space and time, from ∼25 to almost 150 Hz1,9,10,11,12,13. Here we show that gamma oscillations in the CA1 area of the hippocampus split into distinct fast and slow frequency components that differentially couple CA1 to inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex, an area that provides information about the animal’s current position14,15,16,17, and CA3, a hippocampal subfield essential for storage of such information14,18,19. Fast gamma oscillations in CA1 were synchronized with fast gamma in medial entorhinal cortex, and slow gamma oscillations in CA1 were coherent with slow gamma in CA3. Significant proportions of cells in medial entorhinal cortex and CA3 were phase-locked to fast and slow CA1 gamma waves, respectively. The two types of gamma occurred at different phases of the CA1 theta rhythm and mostly on different theta cycles. These results point to routeing of information as a possible function of gamma frequency variations in the brain and provide a mechanism for temporal segregation of potentially interfering information from different sources.},

However, by analyzing simulated and actual LFPs, here we question the existence of theta-gamma phase-phase coupling in the rat hippocampus. We show that the quasi-linear phase shifts introduced by filtering lead to spurious coupling levels in both white noise and hippocampal LFPs, which highly depend on epoch length, and that significant coupling may be falsely detected when employing improper surrogate methods. We also show that waveform asymmetry and frequency harmonics may generate artifactual n:m phase-locking.

	abstract = {We apply common linear analysis techniques (Fourier and wavelet transforms) to timeseries of hippocampal local ﬁeld potential (LFP) collected from a small population of rats (5 individuals) during awake-behavior in a maze-exploring task, and rest (non-REM sleep). Important characteristics of hippocampal activity, such as the power of the theta rhythm and its harmonics, as well as that of the gamma rhythm, are strongly dependent on the intensity of behavioral activity, as measured by rat speed. A comparison of Fourier and wavelet representation of stationary LFP epochs show that the wavelet representation fails to resolve high-order theta harmonics (24, 32, 40 Hz) that appear well deﬁned in the Fourier analysis and occupy the frequency band of 20-50 Hz, also attributed to the slow gamma rhythm. It seems possible that a misinterpretation of wavelet analysis might be the origin of the identiﬁcation of the slow gamma rhythm. Such a misidentiﬁcation would also naturally lead to spurious coupling results between the low gamma and theta oscillations. Theoretically, both transforms can handle arbitrary time-series; however, the Fourier transform is best interpreted for weakly phase-coupled, nearly-Gaussian stochastic processes, while the wavelet transform is most useful when applied to non-stationary, transient processes. Outside their optimal applicability range, both transforms may produce ambiguous, even misleading results. Rather than refuting the existence of slow gamma, our results emphasize the importance of selecting the adequate spectral analysis method for the stochastic process analyzed. To help with the selection, we propose a simple stationarity test based on the integral value of the bicoherence. Further research is needed to separate high order theta harmonics from slow gamma.},

Theories of associative memory suggest that successful memory storage and recall depend on a balance between two complementary processes: pattern separation (to minimize interference) and pattern completion (to retrieve a memory when presented with partial or degraded input cues). Putative attractor circuitry in the hippocampal CA3 region is thought to be the final arbiter between these two processes. Here we present direct, quantitative evidence that CA3 produces an output pattern closer to the originally stored representation than its degraded input patterns from the dentate gyrus (DG). We simultaneously recorded activity from CA3 and DG of behaving rats when local and global reference frames were placed in conflict. CA3 showed a coherent population response to the conflict (pattern completion), even though its DG inputs were severely disrupted (pattern separation). The results thus confirm the hallmark predictions of a longstanding computational model of hippocampal memory processing.},

We examined the neural representation of environmental location provided by hippocampal place cells while mice navigated a virtual reality environment in which both types of information could be manipulated. Extracellular recordings were made from region CA1 of head-fixed mice navigating a virtual linear track and running in a similar real environment. Despite the absence of vestibular motion signals, normal place cell firing and theta rhythmicity were found. Visual information alone was sufficient for localized firing in 25\% of place cells and to maintain a local field potential theta rhythm (but with significantly reduced power). Additional movement-related information was required for normally localized firing by the remaining 75\% of place cells. Trials in which movement and visual information were put into conflict showed that they combined nonlinearly to control firing location, and that the relative influence of movement versus visual information varied widely across place cells. However, within this heterogeneity, the behavior of fully half of the place cells conformed to a model of path integration in which the presence of visual cues at the start of each run together with subsequent movement-related updating of position was sufficient to maintain normal fields.},

Many different computational models of grid cell firing use path integration based on movement direction and the associated movement speed to drive grid cells. However, the response of neurons to movement direction has rarely been tested, in contrast to multiple studies showing responses of neurons to head direction. Here, we analyzed the difference between head direction and movement direction during rat movement and analyzed cells recorded from entorhinal cortex for their tuning to movement direction. During foraging behavior, movement direction differs significantly from head direction. The analysis of neuron responses shows that only 5 out of 758 medial entorhinal cells show significant coding for both movement direction and head direction when evaluating periods of rat behavior with speeds above 10 cm/s and ±30° angular difference between movement and head direction. None of the cells coded movement direction alone. In contrast, 21 cells in this population coded only head direction during behavioral epochs with these constraints, indicating much stronger coding of head direction in this population. This suggests that the movement direction signal required by most grid cell models may arise from other brain structures than the medial entorhinal cortex.

Unlike place cells, which code only for the animal's location, or head-direction cells, which code only for the animal's directional heading, TPD cells code for both the location and the head direction of the animal. Their firing is also strongly theta modulated, firing primarily at the negative-to-positive phase of the locally recorded theta wave. TPD theta modulation is significantly stronger than that of place cells. In contrast, the firing of head-direction cells is not modulated by theta at all. In repeated exposures to the same environment, the locational and directional signals of TPD cells are stable. When recorded in different environments, TPD locational and directional fields can uncouple, with the locational field shifting unpredictably (“remapping”), whereas the directional preference remains similar across environments.},

Background
Neural circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) support translation of the external environment to an internal map of space, with grid and head direction neurons providing metrics for distance and orientation.
Results
We show here that head direction cells in MEC are organized topographically. Head direction tuning varies widely across the entire dorsoventral MEC axis, but in layer III there is a gradual dorsal-to-ventral increase in the average width of the directional firing field. Sharply tuned cells were encountered only at the dorsal end of MEC. Similar topography was not observed among head direction cells in layers V–VI. At all MEC locations, in all layers, the preferred firing direction (directional phase) showed a uniform distribution. The continuity of the dorsoventral tuning gradient coexisted with discrete topography in the spatial scale of simultaneously recorded grid cells.
Conclusions
The findings point to dorsoventral gradients as a fundamental property of entorhinal circuits, upon which modular organization may be expressed in select subpopulations.},

	abstract = {Summary
Head direction (HD) cells are neurons found in an extended cortical and subcortical network that signal the orientation of an animal’s head relative to its environment [1, 2, 3]. They are a fundamental component of the wider circuit of spatially responsive hippocampal formation neurons that make up the neural cognitive map of space [4]. During post-natal development, HD cells are the first among spatially modulated neurons in the hippocampal circuit to exhibit mature firing properties [5, 6], but before eye opening, HD cell responses in rat pups have low directional information and are directionally unstable [7, 8]. Using Bayesian decoding of HD cell ensemble activity recorded in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (ADN), we characterize this instability and identify its source: under-signaling of angular head velocity, which incompletely shifts the directional signal in proportion to head turns. We find evidence that geometric cues (the corners of a square environment) can be used to mitigate this under-signaling and, thereby, stabilize the directional signal even before eye opening. Crucially, even when directional firing cannot be stabilized, ensembles of unstable HD cells show short-timescale (1–10 s) temporal and spatial couplings consistent with an adult-like HD network. The HD network is widely modeled as a continuous attractor whose output is one coherent activity peak, updated during movement by angular head velocity signals and anchored by landmark cues [9, 10, 11]. Our findings present strong evidence for this model, and they demonstrate that the required network circuitry is in place and functional early during development, independent of reference to landmark information.},

We placed lesions in the hippocampus and recorded from HD cells in the postsubiculum and anterior thalamus. Lesions of the hippocampus did not disrupt the HD cell signal in either brain area, indicating that the HD cell signal must be generated by structures external to the hippocampus. In addition, each cell’s preferred firing direction remained stable across days when the lesioned animal was placed into a novel environment. This stability appeared to weaken after several weeks of nonexposure to the new enclosure for two out of five animals, and subsequently recorded cells from these two animals established a new angular relationship between the familiar and novel environments. Our results suggest that extra-hippocampal structures are capable of creating and maintaining a novel representation of the animal’s environmental context. This representation shares features in common with mnemonic processes involving episodic memory that until now were assumed to require an intact hippocampus.},

	abstract = {Rodents use two distinct navigation strategies that are based on environmental cues (landmark navigation) or internal cues (path integration). Head direction (HD) cells are neurons that discharge when the animal points its head in a particular direction and are responsive to the same cues that support path integration and landmark navigation. Experiment 1 examined whether HD cells in rats with lesions to the hippocampus plus the overlying neocortex or to just the overlying neocortex could maintain a stable preferred firing direction when the rats locomoted from a familiar to a novel environment, a process thought to require path integration. HD cells from both lesion groups were unable to maintain a similar preferred direction between environments, with cells from hippocampal rats showing larger shifts than cells from rats sustaining only cortical damage. When the rats first explored the novel environment, the preferred directions of the cells drifted for up to 4 min before establishing a consistent firing orientation. The preferred direction was usually maintained during subsequent visits to the novel environment but not across longer time periods (days to weeks). Experiment 2 demonstrated that a novel landmark cue was able to establish control over HD cell preferred directions in rats from both lesion groups, showing that the impairment observed in experiment 1 cannot be attributed to an impairment in establishing cue control. Experiment 3 showed that the preferred direction drifted when HD cells in lesioned animals were recorded in the dark. It was also shown that the anticipatory property of anterodorsal thalamic nucleus HD cells was still present in lesioned animals; thus, this property cannot be attributed to an intact hippocampus. These findings suggest that the hippocampus and the overlying neocortex are involved in path integration mechanisms, which enable an animal to maintain an accurate representation of its directional heading when exploring a novel environment.},

"Spatial view" cells, which respond when the monkey looks at a part of the environment were analyzed. It is shown that many of these cells retain their spatial characteristics when the view details are obscured totally by curtains and by darkness. It is shown that many of these cells respond more when the monkey is gazing toward one location in the room than toward other locations, even though none of the view details can be seen. Such cells were found in the CA1 region, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the presubiculum. Other cells stopped responding when the monkey looked toward the normally effective location in the environment if the view details were obscured. These cells were in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. The results indicate that for CA3 cells, the visual input is necessary for the normal spatial response of the neurons, and for other cells in the primate hippocampal formation, the response still depends on the monkey gazing toward that location in space when the view details are obscured. These latter cells therefore could reflect the operation of a memory system, in which the neuronal activity can be triggered by factors that probably include not only eye position command/feedback signals, but also probably vestibular and/or proprioceptive inputs. This representation of space "out there" would be an appropriate part of a primate memory system involved in memories of where in an environment an object was seen and more generally in the memory of particular events or episodes for which a spatial component normally provides part of the context.},

In the literature, the ProS (in primate) and PoS (in rodent) are inconstantly identified, making data comparison difficult across species. This review is an attempt to discuss equivalencies and extent of the five subicular components in human, monkey, and rodent based on available information on their cytoarchitecture, chemoarchitecture, molecular signature, and neural connectivity. All five subicular cortices exist in human, monkey, and rodent. In human and monkey, the ProS and Sub extend into the uncal region anteriorly, and the PoS and PaS reach the cingulate isthmus posteriorly. In rodent, most of the typical subicular cortices are located in the dorsal and caudal portions of the hippocampal formation, and the modified version of the ventral ProS and Sub corresponds to the modified description of the uncal ProS and Sub in monkey and human. An interesting triangular region in rodent located at the juncture of the PoS, PaS, retrosplenial cortex, and visual cortex appears to be the equivalent of the monkey area prostriata. Major connections of the five subicular cortices are also summarized based on unified criteria discussed in this review, with distinct connections revealed between the ProS and the Sub. J. Comp.

Lesions of the entire vestibular labyrinth have previously been shown to severely alter VIIIth nerve input and disrupt these HD signals. To assess the specific contributions of the semicircular canals without altering tonic VIIIth nerve input, ADN cells were recorded from chinchillas following bilateral semicircular canal occlusion. While ADN HD cells (and also hippocampal place cells and theta cells) were identified in intact chinchillas, no direction-specific activity was seen following canal occlusions. Instead, “bursty” cells were observed that exhibited burst-firing patterns similar to normal HD cells, but with firing unrelated to the animal’s actual head direction. Importantly, when pairs of bursty cells were recorded, the temporal order of their firing was dependent upon the animal’s turning direction, as is the case for pairs of normal HD cells. These results suggest that bursty cells are actually disrupted HD cells. The present findings further suggest that the HD cell network is still able to generate spiking activity following canal occlusions, but the semicircular canal input is critical for updating the network activity in register with changes in the animal’s HD.},

We review models and experimental evidence for three systems in the rat brain that are presumed to be components of the rat's navigational and memory system. Head-direction cells have been modeled as a ring attractor, grid cells as a plane attractor, and place cells both as a plane attractor and as a point attractor. Whereas the models have proven to be extremely useful conceptual tools, the experimental evidence in their favor, although intriguing, is still mostly circumstantial.},

Reference frames are important for understanding how sensory cues from different modalities are coordinated to guide behavior, and the parietal cortex is critical to these functions. We compare reference frames of vestibular self-motion signals in the ventral intraparietal area (VIP), parietoinsular vestibular cortex (PIVC), and dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd). Vestibular heading tuning in VIP is invariant to changes in both eye and head positions, indicating a body (or world)-centered reference frame. Vestibular signals in PIVC have reference frames that are intermediate between head and body centered. In contrast, MSTd neurons show reference frames between head and eye centered but not body centered. Eye and head position gain fields were strongest in MSTd and weakest in PIVC. Our findings reveal distinct spatial reference frames for representing vestibular signals and pose new challenges for understanding the respective roles of these areas in potentially diverse vestibular functions.},

	abstract = {Summary
Animals rely upon integrated sensory information for spatial navigation. A question of wide importance in navigation is how sensory cues get transformed into neural codes that represent the animal’s orientation within its proximal environment. Here, we investigated the possibility of head-direction coding in the central complex of the cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis. We used extracellular recordings in restrained animals that were rotated on a platform relative to a fixed landmark. The passive rotations allowed us to test for head-direction coding in the absence of self-generated motion cues. Our results indicate that individual cells in the central complex encode the animal’s heading relative to a landmark’s position in several ways. In some cells, directional tuning was established even in the absence of visual cues, suggesting that the directional code can be maintained solely based on the internal motion cues derived from the passive rotations. Additionally, some cells in the central complex encoded rotation-direction history, a navigational context cue, by increasing or decreasing the firing rate during the stationary periods following clockwise or counterclockwise rotations. Together, these results unveil head-direction cell-like activity in the insect central complex, which highly resemble similarly functioning cells in the mammalian brain that encode head direction. We predict that the observed head-orientation coding and directionally sensitive cells are essential components of the brain circuitry mediating insect navigation.},

One radial arm maze task provided both intramaze and extramaze cues, whereas the other task provided only extramaze cues. The Barnes maze task provided only extramaze cues. On the radial arm maze, tilted mice performed similar to control mice when intramaze cues were available, but committed more working and reference memory errors than control mice when only extramaze cues were available. On the Barnes maze task, control and tilted mice showed similar latency, distance, and errors during acquisition training. On the subsequent probe trial, both groups spent the greatest percentage of time in the goal quadrant, indicating they were able to use extramaze cues to guide their search. Overall, these results suggest signals originating in the otolith organs contribute to spatial memory, but are not necessary for all aspects of spatial performance.},

The anterodorsal and laterodorsal neurons were recorded under 2 conditions: 1) control sessions, in which both the stage and the treadmill moved forward, or 2) backward (mismatch) sessions, in which the stage was moved backward while the rats ran forward on the treadmill. Of the 222 thalamic neurons recorded, 55 showed differential responses to the directions to window (south) and door (north) sides, along which the animals were translocated in the long axis of the trajectory. Of these 55 direction-related neurons, 15 showed heading direction-dependent responses regardless of movement direction (forward or backward movements). Thirteen neurons displayed heading and movement direction-dependent responses, and, of these 13, activity of 6 neurons increased during forward movement to the window or door side, while activity of the remaining 7 neurons increased during backward movement to the window or door side. Eighteen neurons showed movement direction-related responses regardless of heading direction. Furthermore, activity of some direction-related neurons increased only in a specific trajectory. These results suggested that the activity of these neurons reflects complex combinations of facing direction (landmarks), movement direction (optic flow/vestibular information), motor/proprioceptive information and the trajectory of the movement.},

	abstract = {A retrospective clinical study focused on the frequency of rotational vertigo in 63 patients with acute unilateral midbrain strokes involving the vestibular and ocular motor systems. In contrast to unilateral pontomedullary brainstem lesions, rotational vertigo in midbrain lesions occurred with a low frequency (14\%) and transient ({\textless} 1 day) course. Swaying vertigo or unspecific dizziness (22\%) and postural imbalance (31\%) were more frequent. Midbrain strokes with transient rotational vertigo manifested with lesions chiefly in the caudal midbrain tegmentum, while manifestations with swaying, unspecific, or no vertigo chiefly occurred in rostral mesencephalic or meso-diencephalic lesions. We hypothesize that these different manifestations can be explained by the distribution of two separate cell systems based on semicircular canal function: the angular head-velocity cells and the head direction cells, both of which code for head rotation. Animal experiments have shown that angular head-velocity cells are located mainly in the lower brainstem up to the midbrain, whereas the head direction cells are found from the midbrain and thalamic level up to cortical regions. Due to the differences in coding, unilateral dysfunction of the angular velocity cell system should result in the sensation of rotation, while unilateral dysfunction of the head direction cell system should result in dizziness and unsteadiness. We simulated the different manifestations of vestibular dysfunction using a mathematical neural network model of the head direction cell system. This model predicted and confirmed our clinical findings that unilateral caudal and rostral brainstem lesions have different effects on vestibular function.},

How the different inputs are recruited during postnatal development remains unclear. We hypothesize that glutamatergic transmission at the vestibular nucleus contributes to developmental registration of head orientations along the vestibulo-olivary pathway. To investigate the maturation profile by which head rotational signals are registered in the brainstem, we used sinusoidal rotations on the orthogonal planes of the three pairs of semicircular canals. Fos expression was used as readout of neurons responsive to the rotational stimulus. Neurons in the vestibular nucleus and prepositus hypoglossal nucleus responded to all rotations as early as P4 and reached adult numbers by P21. In the reticular formation and inferior olive, neurons also responded to horizontal rotations as early as P4 but to vertical rotations not until P21 and P25, respectively. Neuronal subpopulations that distinguish between rotations activating the orthogonally oriented vertical canals were identifiable in the medial and spinal vestibular nuclei by P14 and in the inferior olivary subnuclei IOβ and IOK by P25. Neonatal perturbation of glutamate transmission in the vestibular nucleus was sufficient to derange formation of this distribution in the inferior olive. This is the first demonstration that developmental refinement of glutamatergic synapses in the central vestibular circuitry is essential for developmental registration of head rotational signals in the brainstem.},

We first consider the classic view of the head direction cell and results of recent experiments in rodents and primates indicating that inputs to these neurons encode multimodal information during self-motion, such as proprioceptive and motor efference copy signals, including gaze-related information. We also consider the paradox that, while the head-direction network is generally assumed to generate a fixed representation of perceived directional heading, this computation would need to be dynamically updated when the relationship between voluntary motor command and its sensory consequences changes. Such situations include navigation in virtual reality and head-restricted conditions, since the natural relationship between visual and extravisual cues is altered.},

	abstract = {Human heading perception based on optic flow is not only accurate, it is also remarkably robust and stable. These qualities are especially apparent when observers move through environments containing other moving objects, which introduce optic flow that is inconsistent with observer self-motion and therefore uninformative about heading direction. Moving objects may also occupy large portions of the visual field and occlude regions of the background optic flow that are most informative about heading perception. The fact that heading perception is biased by no more than a few degrees under such conditions attests to the robustness of the visual system and warrants further investigation. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether recurrent, competitive dynamics among MSTd neurons that serve to reduce uncertainty about heading over time offer a plausible mechanism for capturing the robustness of human heading perception. Simulations of existing heading models that do not contain competitive dynamics yield heading estimates that are far more erratic and unstable than human judgments. We present a dynamical model of primate visual areas V1, MT, and MSTd based on that of Layton, Mingolla, and Browning that is similar to the other models, except that the model includes recurrent interactions among model MSTd neurons. Competitive dynamics stabilize the model’s heading estimate over time, even when a moving object crosses the future path. Soft winner-take-all dynamics enhance units that code a heading direction consistent with the time history and suppress responses to transient changes to the optic flow field. Our findings support recurrent competitive temporal dynamics as a crucial mechanism underlying the robustness and stability of perception of heading.},

	abstract = {Estimates of location or orientation can be constructed solely from sensory information representing environmental cues. In unfamiliar or sensory-poor environments, these estimates can also be maintained and updated by integrating self-motion information. However, the accumulation of error dictates that updated representations of heading direction and location become progressively less reliable over time, and must be corrected by environmental sensory inputs when available. Anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioural evidence indicates that angular and translational path integration contributes to the ﬁring of head direction cells and grid cells. We discuss how sensory inputs may be combined with self-motion information in the ﬁring patterns of these cells. For head direction cells, direct projections from egocentric sensory representations of distal cues can help to correct cumulative errors. Grid cells may beneﬁt from sensory inputs via boundary vector cells and place cells. However, the allocentric code of boundary vector cells and place cells requires consistent head-direction information in order to translate the sensory signal of egocentric boundary distance into allocentric boundary vector cell ﬁring, suggesting that the different spatial representations found in and around the hippocampal formation are interdependent. We conclude that, rather than representing pure path integration, the ﬁring of head-direction cells and grid cells reﬂects the interface between self-motion and environmental sensory information. Together with place cells and boundary vector cells they can support a coherent unitary representation of space based on both environmental sensory inputs and path integration signals.},

The septal theta rhythm (6-10 Hz) organizes the spatial activity of place and grid cells in time, but it remains unclear how spatial reference points organize the temporal activity of theta cells in space. We study spatial theta cells in simulations and single-unit recordings from exploring rats to ask whether temporal phase codes may anchor spatial representations to the outside world. We theorize that an experience-independent mechanism for temporal coding may combine with burst synchronization to continuously calibrate self-motion to allocentric reference frames. Subcortical recordings revealed spatial theta cells with strong rate-phase correlations related to distinct theta phases. Simulations of bursting neurons and networks explained that relationship and, with competitive learning, demonstrated flexible spatial synchronization patterns when driven by low-dimensional spatial components from the recording data. Thus temporal coding synchrony may reconcile extrinsic and intrinsic neural codes.},

We introduce a novel behavioural paradigm that allows for probing temporal and spatial contributions to path integration. The paradigm is a bisection task comprising movement in a virtual reality environment in combination with either timing the duration ran or estimating the distance covered. We performed experiments with Mongolian gerbils and could show that the animals can keep track of time and distance during spatial navigation.},

Electrophysiological investigations of the mammalian hippocampus and associated brain structures have identified several classes of neurons which represent information about an organism’s position and orientation. These include place cells, grid cells, head direction cells, and boundary vector cells, as well as cells representing aspects of self-motion. Understanding how these neural representations are formed and updated from environmental sensory information and from information relating to self-motion is an important topic attracting considerable current interest. Here we review the computational mechanisms thought to underlie the formation of these different spatial representations, the interactions between them, and their use in guiding behaviour. These include some of the clearest examples of computational mechanisms of general interest to neuroscience, such as attractor dynamics, temporal coding and multi-modal integration. We also discuss the close relationships between computational modelling and experimental research which are driving progress in this area.},

	abstract = {Spatial encoding in the hippocampus is based on a range of different input sources. To generate spatial representations, reliable sensory cues from the external environment are integrated with idiothetic cues, derived from self-movement, that enable path integration and directional perception. In this study, we examined to what extent idiothetic cues significantly contribute to spatial representations and navigation: we recorded place cells while rodents navigated towards two visually identical chambers in 180° orientation via two different paths in darkness and in the absence of reliable auditory or olfactory cues. Our goal was to generate a conflict between local visual and direction-specific information, and then to assess which strategy was prioritized in different learning phases. We observed that, in the absence of distal cues, place fields are initially controlled by local visual cues that override idiothetic cues, but that with multiple exposures to the paradigm, spaced at intervals of days, idiothetic cues become increasingly implemented in generating an accurate spatial representation. Taken together, these data support that, in the absence of distal cues, local visual cues are prioritized in the generation of context-specific spatial representations through place cells, whereby idiothetic cues are deemed unreliable. With cumulative exposures to the environments, the animal learns to attend to subtle idiothetic cues to resolve the conflict between visual and direction-specific information.},

Rats were trained to perform a food-carrying task with and without blindfolds prior to receiving sham lesions or bilateral lesions of the ADN or DTN. ADN-lesioned rats were mildly impaired in both versions of the task. DTN-lesioned rats, however, were severely impaired and showed reduced heading accuracy in both task versions.

	abstract = {The habenula and interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) are part of a dorsal diencephalic conduction system which receives input from cholinergic, striatal, and hypothalamic areas, and sends output to several, disparate midbrain regions. These output regions include the dorsal tegmental nucleus, which is part of a navigation-related system that provides a signal for directional heading. The habenula and IPN also project to the dorsal and medial Raphe nuclei, thought to be involved in mood and behavioral state regulation. Here, cells in both the habenula and IPN were recorded in freely moving rats while they foraged for food pellets. There were four major ﬁndings. First, many of the cells tended to ﬁre in sporadic bouts of relatively high versus low rates, and this may be related to intrinsic cell properties discovered during in vitro studies. Second, although these regions are connected to the direction signaling circuit, they do not, themselves demonstrate a directional signal. Third, about 10\% of the cells in the lateral habenula showed a strong correlation between rate and angular head motion. This may constitute an important, requisite input to the above-mentioned head direction circuit. Finally, many of the cells in each region showed a temporally coarse correlation with running speed, so that bouts of high frequency ﬁring coincided with episodes of higher behavioral activation. This last ﬁnding may be related to work which shows an inﬂuence of the habenula on locomotor activity, and in relation to the protective effects of exercise in relation to stress, as mediated by the Raphe nuclei.},

	abstract = {Although the functional role of the mammillary bodies has remained obscure, lesion studies suggest this structure may play a role in memory—in particular, memory for spatial information. Indeed, anatomically, the mammillary bodies are strongly interconnected with limbic system regions, such as the hipppocampal formation, which are also thought to play a role in spatial behavior. Each of these limbic regions so far investigated contains cells that signal either the momentary location and/or directional heading of an animal as it travels through space. In fact, the lateral mammillary nucleus itself contains head direction cells, and is thought to be critical for the initial calculation of this directional signal. Here, we provide an initial report on cell activity in the medial mammillary nucleus. Cells were recorded while rats performed a pellet-chasing task that has been used for much of the work on place and head direction cells. The main findings are 1) approximately 1/3 of the cells showed a temporally precise relationship to angular motion of the head, so that they differentially indicated clockwise versus counterclockwise angular motion, 2) approximately 60\% of the cells showed a temporally coarse correlation with translational motion, 3) firing rate for almost all cells was strongly modulated at theta frequency, and 4) no cells showed evidence of either directional or place-related activity. These data suggest that the medial and lateral mammillary nuclei together provide the directional and trajectory information thought to be critical for generation of the spatial signals in the hippocampal region.},

Recent patient studies have, however, re-established the mammillary bodies, and their projections to the anterior thalamus via the mammillothalamic tract, as being crucial for recollective memory. Complementary animal research has also made substantial advances in recent years by determining the electrophysiological, neurochemical, anatomical and functional properties of the mammillary bodies. Mammillary body and mammillothalamic tract lesions in rats impair performance on a number of spatial memory tasks and these deﬁcits are consistent with impoverished spatial encoding. The mammillary bodies have traditionally been considered a hippocampal relay which is consistent with the equivalent deﬁcits seen following lesions of the mammillary bodies or their major efferents, the mammillothalamic tract. However, recent ﬁndings suggest that the mammillary bodies may have a role in memory that is independent of their hippocampal formation afferents; instead, the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden could be providing critical mammillary body inputs needed to support mnemonic processes. Finally, it is now apparent that the medial and lateral mammillary nuclei should be considered separately and initial research indicates that the medial mammillary nucleus is predominantly responsible for the spatial memory deﬁcits following mammillary body lesions in rats.},

	abstract = {Vestibular information influences spatial orientation and navigation in laboratory animals and humans. Neurons within the rat anterior thalamus encode the directional heading of the animal in absolute space. These neurons, referred to as head direction (HD) cells, fire selectively when the rat points its head in a specific direction in the horizontal plane with respect to the external laboratory reference frame. HD cells are thought to represent an essential component of a neural network that processes allocentric spatial information. The functional properties of HD cells may be dependent on vestibular input. Here, anterior thalamic HD cells were recorded before and after sodium arsanilate-induced vestibular system lesion. Vestibular lesions abolished the directional firing properties of HD cells. The time course of disruption in the directional firing properties paralleled the loss of vestibular function. Arsanilate-treated rats exhibited only minor changes in locomotor behavior, which were unlikely to account for the loss of direction-specific firing. Vestibular lesions also disrupted the influence of angular head velocity on anterior thalamic single-unit firing rates. Finally, a subset of anterior thalamic neurons recorded from vestibular-lesioned rats exhibited a pattern of intermittent firing bursts that were distinctly unrelated to HD. This novel anterior thalamic firing pattern has not been encountered in any vestibular-intact rat. These data suggest that: (1) the neural code for directional bearing is critically dependent on vestibular information; and (2) this loss of HD cell information may represent a neurobiological mechanism to account for the orientation and navigational deficits observed after vestibular dysfunction.},

Injections of WGA-HRP into the medial mamillary nucleus resulted in dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the ventral tegmental nucleus, while injections in the lateral mamillary nucleus resulted in dense anterograde labeling in the dorsal tegmental nucleus pars dorsalis and dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the pars ventralis of the dorsal tegmental nucleus. Anterogradely labeled fibers in the mamillotegmental tract diverged from the principal mamillary tract in an extensive dorsocaudally oriented swath of axons which extended to the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei, and numerous axons turned sharply ventrally and rostrally to terminate topographically in the dorsomedial nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and rostromedial pontine nuclei. The anterograde labeling in these two precerebellar relay nuclei was distributed near the midline such that projections from the lateral mamillary nucleus terminated mainly dorsomedial to the terminal fields of projections from the medial mamillary nucleus. In the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei, labeled axon terminals contained round synaptic vesicles and formed asymmetric synaptic junctions primarily with small diameter dendrites and to a lesser extent with neuronal somata. A few labeled terminals contained pleomorphic vesicles and formed symmetric synaptic junctions with dendrites and neuronal somata. Labeled axon terminals were also frequently found in synaptic contact with retrogradely labeled dendrites and neuronal somata in the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei. These findings indicate that neurons in the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei are reciprocally connected with MB projection neurons. In the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and medial pontine nuclei, labeled axon terminals contained round synaptic vesicles and formed asymmetric synaptic junctions primarily with small diameter dendrites. The present study demonstrates that projections from the medial and lateral nuclei of the MB are topographically organized in the mesencephalon and pons. The synaptic morphology of mamillotegmental projections suggests that they may have excitatory influences primarily on the distal dendrites of neurons in these brain regions.},

	abstract = {Responses to linear accelerations in the earth-horizontal plane (typically provoked by tilts of the head or body) are characterized by a stimulus direction that produces the maximal excitation. Although changes in cardiovascular, sympathetic, and respiratory outflow are maximized during pitch, no collection of central vestibular neurons had been identified where pitch responses predominate. In the present study, response properties of neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus were examined in decerebrate cats placed on a turntable. Activation of otolith afferents was provided by constant velocity rotation with the turntable axis tilted 5 degrees from the vertical. Responsive neurons exhibited a sinusoidal modulation in their firing rate; the optimal excitatory stimulus direction was derived from responses to clockwise and counterclockwise rotations. Many of these neurons were also tested for input from horizontal semicircular canals using 0.5 Hz sinusoidal rotation about an earth-vertical axis. Of 22 tilt-sensitive neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus whose optimal stimulus direction was determined, 9 were best stimulated by pitch, 10 by stimuli in one of the two vertical semicircular canal planes, and 3 by roll. Of the 33 neurons in this nucleus tested for possible convergent inputs from the otolith organs and the horizontal semicircular canals, 8 responded to both the constant velocity (otolith) stimulus and to the sinusoidal rotation, 7 appeared to receive otolith, but not horizontal canal, input, while 18 had a canal, but no otolith, response. Thus, besides serving as a relay for horizontal canal signals, the medial vestibular nucleus may also be an important relay for information about orientation within the sagittal (pitch) plane.},

Among them, VGluT2 mRNA is expressed predominantly throughout the dorsal thalamus, whereas VGluT1 mRNA is expressed in a few thalamic nuclei. In the thalamic nuclei that project to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), VGluT1 mRNA is expressed strongly in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (AD), is expressed moderately in the anteroventral and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei, and is not expressed in the anteromedial thalamic nucleus. Thus, it has been strongly suggested that a subset of thalamocortical projections to RSC possesses both VGluT1 and VGluT2. In this study, double-labeled neuronal somata showing both VGluT1 and VGluT2 immunolabelings were found exclusively in the ventral region of AD (vAD). Many double-labeled axon terminals were also found in two major targets of vAD, the rostral part of the reticular thalamic nucleus and layers Ia and III–IV of the retrosplenial granular b cortex (RSGb). Some were also found in layer Ia of the retrosplenial granular a cortex (RSGa). These axon terminals contain significant amounts of both VGluTs. Because the subset of thalamocortical projections to RSC has a unique molecular basis in the glutamatergic transmission system, it might play an important role in the higher cognitive functions processed in the RSC. Furthermore, double-labeled axon terminals of a different type were distributed in RSGb and RSGa. Because they are small and the immunoreactivity of VGluT2 is significantly weaker than that of VGluT1, they seemed to be a subset of corticocortical terminals. J. Comp.

The m2-immunolabeling was preferentially distributed in the distal dendrite region where cholinergic afferent fibers tend to terminate and in the peripheral region of somata, whereas the m3-immunolabeling was more preferentially distributed in a large part of somata and in proximal dendrite shafts than in the distal dendrite region. Dual-immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that majority of rRt neurons with parvalbumin immunoreactivity contain both m2 and m3. Neither m2 nor m3 was detected in presynaptic terminals or axonal elements. No m4-immunolabeling was detected in the rostral part of the thalamus including rRt. These results show the different distributions of m2 and m3 in rRt neurons, and strongly suggest that m2 is more closely associated with cholinergic afferents than m3.},

The anterior thalamus is a part of extended hippocampal system and its significance for learning and memory processes is well known. Although our knowledge about a specific role of this brain structure has increased in recent years considerably, this is the first attempt to summarize neurochemical diversity of the anterior thalamus. The following groups of bioactive substances are reviewed: (1) classical neurotransmitters (gammaaminobutyric acid, glutamate and aspartate, acetylcholine, serotonin) and their receptors, (2) calcium-binding proteins (calretinin, calbindin, parvalbumin), and (3) others (cocaineand amphetamine regulated transcript, enkephalins, substance P). In order to extend our knowledge concerning exact functions of selected neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the studied brain structure, the future studies should concentrate on potential alterations in the neurochemical profile during various pathological states which affect the anterior thalamic nuclei.},

Injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the medial mammillary nucleus resulted in retrogradely labelled neurons in the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden, whereas injections into the lateral mammillary nucleus resulted in large numbers of retrogradely labelled neurons in the ipsilateral dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden and in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. In the ventral tegmental nucleus, moderate to small numbers of retrogradely labelled neurons were also immunolabelled for GABA and approximately ten to 18 WGA-HRP-labelled neurons per section were immunoreactive for leu-enkephalin. In addition, small numbers of WGA-HRP-labelled neurons in the principal subnucleus of the ventral tegmental nucleus were immunoreactive for Glu whereas small numbers of retrogradely labelled neurons in the compact subnucleus of the central superior nucleus displayed neurotensin-like immunoreactivity. In the ventral subnucleus of the dorsal tegmental nucleus, moderate to small numbers of retrogradely labelled neurons were also GABA-immunoreactive and approximately ten to 14 WGA-HRP labelled neurons per section were immunoreactive for leu-enkephalin. The ventral subnucleus of the dorsal tegmental nucleus also contained small numbers of retrogradely labelled neurons that displayed either glutamate or substance P-like immunoreactivity. In addition, moderate to small numbers of WGA-HRP-labelled neurons (five to 20 per section) in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus were immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase. These results are compatible with the possibility that tegmentomammillary projection neurons use several different neurochemicals as neurotransmitter(s) and/or neuromodulator(s).},

	abstract = {In 1937 Papez described an anatomical circuit (or loop) beginning and ending in the hippocampal formation that he proposed subserved emotional experience (Papez, 1937). Specifically, the projections of the circuit were as follows: hippocampal formation→ mammillary bodies→ anterior thalamus→ cingulate cortex→ parahippocampal gyrus→ hippocampal formation. Although the circuit has been refined based on subsequent anatomical findings (Amaral and Witter, 1995, Shibata, 1992, Van Groen and Wyss, 1995), the major links of the circuit unquestionably represent a prominent system of connections in the mammalian brain. Hence, the enduring nature of ‘Papez’s circuit’. Unlike, however, its persistence as anatomical entity, the proposed functional role for the circuit has been less resilient. The early notion that Papez’s circuit subserves emotional experience/expression has been abandoned (LeDoux, 1993) and replaced by the proposal that it is primarily involved in mnemonic functions (Aggleton and Brown, 1999). Lesions of each of the major components of the circuit have been shown to disrupt memory (Aggleton and Brown, 1999, Sutherland et al., 1988, Sziklas and Petrides, 1993). The mammillary bodies represent a major output from the hippocampus in Papez’s circuit (Amaral and Witter, 1995). It has recently been shown that cells of mammillary body fire rhythmically in bursts synchronous with the theta rhythm of the hippocampus (Bland et al., 1995, Kirk et al., 1996, Kocsis and Vertes, 1994, Kocsis and Vertes, 1997) and that this rhythmical activity is dependent upon the action of the hippocampus on the mammillary bodies (Bland et al., 1995, Kirk et al., 1996). It is well established that the mammillary bodies project massively to the anterior thalamus (Shibata, 1992), which taken together with the demonstration that mammillary body cells fire synchronously with theta, suggests that the mammillary bodies may act on the anterior thalamus, possibly in the manner that the hippocampus acts on the mammillary bodies, to rhythmically activate cells of the anterior thalamus at theta frequency. We demonstrated that approximately 75\% of cells of the anterior ventral nucleus of the thalamus fire rhythmically synchronous with the hippocampal theta rhythm and the activity of 46\% of these anterior ventral neurons was highly correlated with theta. These findings, together with demonstration of theta-rhythmically firing cells in other structures of Papez’s circuit, indicate that a theta-rhythmic signal may resonate throughout Papez’s circuit, possibly involved in the control of mnemonic functions of the circuit.},

However, the organization of reciprocal corticothalamic projections has not yet been studied comprehensively. In the present study, we clarified the organization of anterior cingulate and frontal cortical projections to the anterior and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei, using retrograde and anterograde axonal transport methods. The anteromedial nucleus (AM) receives mainly ipsilateral projections from the prelimbic and medial orbital cortices and bilateral projections from the anterior cingulate and secondary motor cortices. The projections from the anterior cingulate cortex are organized such that the rostrocaudal axis of the AM corresponds to the rostrocaudal axis of the cortex, whereas those from the secondary motor cortex are organized such that the rostrocaudal axis of the AM corresponds to the caudorostral axis of the cortex. The ventromedial part of the anteroventral nucleus receives ipsilateral projections from the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral projections from the secondary motor cortex, in a topographic manner similar to the projections to the AM. The ventromedial part of the laterodorsal nucleus (LD) receives ipsilateral projections from the anterior cingulate and secondary motor cortices. The projections are roughly organized such that more dorsal and ventral regions within the ventromedial LD receive projections preferentially from the anterior cingulate cortex. The difference in anterior cingulate and frontal cortical projections to the anterior and laterodorsal nuclei may suggest that each thalamic nucleus plays a different functional role in spatial memory processing.},

	abstract = {Injury to the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) may affect both hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex thus explaining some parallels between diencephalic and medial temporal lobe amnesias. We found that standard-housed rats with ATN lesions, compared with standard-housed controls, showed reduced spine density in hippocampal CA1 neurons (basal dendrites, 211.2\%; apical dendrites, 29.6\%) and in retrospenial granular b cortex (Rgb) neurons (apical dendrites, 220.1\%) together with spatial memory deﬁcits on cross maze and radial-arm maze tasks. Additional rats with ATN lesions were also shown to display a severe deﬁcit on spatial working memory in the cross-maze, but subsequent enriched housing ameliorated their performance on both this task and the radial-arm maze. These enriched rats with ATN lesions also showed recovery of both basal and apical CA1 spine density to levels comparable to that of the standard-housed controls, but no recovery of Rgb spine density. Inspection of spine types in the CA1 neurons showed that ATN lesions reduced the density of thin spines and mushroom spines, but not stubby spines; while enrichment promoted recovery of thin spines. Comparison with enriched rats that received pseudo-training, which provided comparable task-related experience, but no explicit spatial memory training, suggested that basal CA1 spine density in particular was associated with spatial learning and memory performance. Distal pathology in terms of reduced integrity of hippocampal and retrosplenial microstructure provides clear support for the inﬂuence of the ATN lesions on the extended hippocampal system. The reversal by postoperative enrichment of this deﬁcit in the hippocampus but not the retrosplenial cortex may indicate region-speciﬁc mechanisms of recovery after ATN injury.

To interpret visual-motion events, the underlying computation must involve internal reference to the motion status of the observer’s head. We show here that layer 6 (L6) principal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) receive a diffuse, vestibular-mediated synaptic input that signals the angular velocity of horizontal rotation. Behavioral and theoretical experiments indicate that these inputs, distributed over a network of 100 L6 neurons, provide both a reliable estimate and, therefore, physiological separation of head-velocity signals. During head rotation in the presence of visual stimuli, L6 neurons exhibit postsynaptic responses that approximate the arithmetic sum of the vestibular and visual-motion response. Functional input mapping reveals that these internal motion signals arrive into L6 via a direct projection from the retrosplenial cortex. We therefore propose that visual-motion processing in V1 L6 is multisensory and contextually dependent on the motion status of the animal’s head.},

ADN-lesioned rats were mildly impaired in both versions of the task. DTN-lesioned rats, however, were severely impaired and showed reduced heading accuracy in both task versions.

In contrast, the anteromedial (AM)and lateral dorsal (LD)nuclei project heavily to Rag and more lightly to Rg. Irrespective of terminal field in Rg or Rag, the neuronal cell bodies in AD and AV are organized topographically so that the neurons in the caudal part of each nucleus project to rostral retrosplenial cortex and the neurons in the rostral portion of each nucleus project to the caudal retrosplenial cortex. Further, the ventromedial AD and AV neurons project to rostral retrosplenial cortex, whereas dorsolateral neurons in both nuclei project to caudal retrosplenial cortex. LD neurons display a different topographic organization. The neurons in the medioventral part of LD project primarily to the rostral retrosplenial cortex, and the neurons in lateral LD project to the caudal retrosplenial cortex. This latter projection to the caudal retrosplenial cortex is also contributed to by neurons residing in the mediodorsal part of caudal LD. The neurons in AM that project to the retrosplenial cortex display less segregation than the AV, AD, or LD neurons. In all experiments, a number of neurons in the dorsal ventro-anterolateral nucleus were labeled by retrosplenial injections. The largest number of cells in this nucleus were labeled after Rag injections, and these were topographically organized such that the neurons projecting to the rostral Rag were located immediately deep to the internal medullary lamina, and the neurons projecting to the caudal Rag were more ventrally located. Very few thalamic neurons have axon collaterals to different areas of the retrosplenial cortex as shown by double labeling experiments.

Functions of the retrosplenial cortex at the local circuit level, however, remain unclear. Herein, we show how signals traveling from the visual cortex behave in local circuits of the retrosplenial cortex, using optical recording methods and application of caffeine to rat brain slices. Electrical signals evoked in the primary visual cortex penetrated into the deep layer of the retrosplenial granular a cortex (RSGa) and propagated further toward postsubiculum and upper layer. Non-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent initial traveling signal from the visual cortex triggered NMDA receptor-dependent neural oscillation in the RSGa. Oscillatory signals originated from the local area in the deep layer of the RSGa, and the signal spread back and forth toward the visual cortex and postsubiculum, in addition to spreading toward the upper layer. From the perspective of the RSGa, extrinsic signal inputs from the visual cortex switched on neural oscillators in the RSGa that deliver NMDA receptor-dependent intrinsic signal outputs. Opening and strengthening of non-NMDA receptor-dependent input pathways from the visual cortex required NMDA receptor-dependent oscillatory neural activities. These input and output relationships indicate that the retrosplenial cortex may represent an important relay station between the visual cortex and hippocampal formation.},

Adult Sprague Á/Dawley rats received bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of LD, and 2 weeks later the rats were tested in a repeated acquisition water maze task. The control groups displayed a short final escape latency and showed a preference for the correct quadrant in the probe trial. Rats with a lesion restricted to LD (LDL) were mildly impaired in the task, but rats with lesions that destroyed LD and also significantly (50\%) damaged the adjacent anterior thalamic nuclei (LDL'/) were severely impaired, displaying no improvement in performing the spatial task. In a second experiment, training in the same paradigm for 2 weeks resulted in improved final performance by LDL and control rats but not by LDL'/ rats.

	abstract = {Several cortical and diencephalic limbic brain regions incorporate neurons that fire in correlation with the speed of whole-body motion, also known as linear velocity. Besides the field mapping and head-directional information, the linear velocity is among the major signals that guide animal’s spatial navigation. Large neuronal populations in the same limbic regions oscillate with theta rhythm during spatial navigation or attention episodes; and the frequency of theta also correlates with linear velocity. A functional similarity between these brain areas is that their inactivation impairs the ability to form new spatial memories; whereas an anatomical similarity is that they all receive projections from medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex. We review recent findings supporting the model that septal theta rhythm integrates different sensorimotor signals necessary for spatial navigation. The medial septal is described here as a circuitry that mediates experience-dependent balance of sustained attention and path integration during navigation. We discuss the hypothesis that theta rhythm serves as a key mechanism for the aligning of intrinsic spatial representation to 1) rapid change of position in the spatial environment 2) continuous alteration of sensory signals throughout navigation and 3) adapting levels of attentional behaviour. The synchronization of these spatial, somatosensory and neuromodulatory signals is proposed here to be anatomically and physiologically mediated by the medial septum.},

Recent studies have suggested an oscillatory hierarchy with faster oscillations being locked to preferred phases of underlying slower waves, a functional principle applied up to the level of action potential generation. We here tested the idea that amplitude-phase coupling between frequencies might serve the detection of weak sensory signals. To this end we recorded neuromagnetic responses during a motion discrimination task using near-threshold stimuli. Amplitude modulation of occipital high-frequency oscillations in the gamma range (63 ± 5 Hz) was phase locked to a slow-frequency oscillation in the delta band (1–5 Hz). Most importantly, the strength of gamma amplitude modulation reﬂected the success in visual discrimination. This correlation provides evidence for the hypothesis that coupling between low- and high-frequency brain oscillations subserves signal detection.},

	abstract = {Electrophysiological oscillations in different frequency bands co-occur with perceptual, motor and cognitive processes but their function and respective contributions to these processes need further investigations. Here, we recorded MEG signals and seek for percept related modulations of alpha, beta and gamma band activity during a perceptual form/motion integration task. Participants reported their bound or unbound perception of ambiguously moving displays that could either be seen as a whole square-like shape moving along a Lissajou's figure (bound percept) or as pairs of bars oscillating independently along cardinal axes (unbound percept). We found that beta (15–25 Hz), but not gamma (55–85 Hz) oscillations, index perceptual states at the individual and group level. The gamma band activity found in the occipital lobe, although significantly higher during visual stimulation than during base line, is similar in all perceptual states. Similarly, decreased alpha activity during visual stimulation is not different for the different percepts. Trial-by-trial classification of perceptual reports based on beta band oscillations was significant in most observers, further supporting the view that modulation of beta power reliably index perceptual integration of form/motion stimuli, even at the individual level.},

	abstract = {The presubiculum contains head direction cells that are crucial for spatial orientation. Here, we examined the connectivity and strengths of thalamic inputs to presubicular layer 3 neurons projecting to the medial entorhinal cortex in the mouse. We recorded pairs of projection neurons and interneurons while optogenetically stimulating afferent fibers from the anterior thalamic nuclei. Thalamic input differentially affects presubicular neurons: layer 3 pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are directly and monosynaptically activated, with depressing dynamics, whereas somatostatin-expressing interneurons are indirectly excited, during repetitive anterior thalamic nuclei activity. This arrangement ensures that the thalamic excitation of layer 3 cells is often followed by disynaptic inhibition. Feedforward inhibition is largely mediated by parvalbumin interneurons, which have a high probability of connection to presubicular pyramidal cells, and it may enforce temporally precise head direction tuning during head turns. Our data point to the potential contribution of presubicular microcircuits for fine-tuning thalamic head direction signals transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT How microcircuits participate in shaping neural inputs is crucial to understanding information processing in the brain. Here, we show how the presubiculum may process thalamic head directional information before transmitting it to the medial entorhinal cortex. Synaptic inputs from the anterior thalamic nuclei excite layer 3 pyramidal cells and parvalbumin interneurons, which mediate disynaptic feedforward inhibition. Somatostatin interneurons are excited indirectly. Presubicular circuits may switch between two regimens depending on the angular velocity of head movements. During immobility, somatostatin-pyramidal cell interactions could support maintained head directional firing with attractor-like dynamics. During rapid head turns, in contrast, parvalbumin-mediated feedforward inhibition may act to tune the head direction signal transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.},

Here, we attempt to link the current knowledge of afferent and efferent connectivity of the presubiculum to the processing of the head direction signal. We describe the cytoarchitecture of the presubicular six-layered cortex and the morphological and electrophysiological intrinsic properties of principal neurons and interneurons. While the presubicular head direction signal depends on synaptic input from thalamus, the intra- and interlaminar information flow in the microcircuit of the presubiculum may contribute to refine directional tuning. The interaction of a specific interneuron type, the Martinotti cells, with the excitatory pyramidal cells may maintain the head direction signal in the presubiculum with attractor-like properties.},

Cue cells accounted for a large fraction of unidentified MEC cells. They exhibited firing fields only near visual cues during virtual navigation and spatially stable activity during navigation in a real arena. Cue cells' responses occurred in sequences repeated at each cue and were likely driven by visual inputs. In layers 2/3 of the MEC, cue cells formed clusters. Anatomically adjacent cue cells responded similarly to cues. These cue cell properties demonstrate that the MEC circuits contain a code representing spatial landmarks that could play a significant role in error correction during path integration.},

This study examined the question of whether the striatum should be regarded as functioning independently of or acting in concert with limbic structures. Dorsal striatal head direction cells and hippocampal place cells were recorded in parallel while rats performed a hippocampal-dependent radial maze task. Changes in the directional preference of head direction cells and the location of place fields were compared following alterations of the sensory environment. When familiar visual cues were presented in new spatial arrangements, or when new visual cues were placed in a familiar environment, rotations of directional preferences were consistent with the mean place-field response. When familiar visual and nonvisual cues were presented in conflict, or when rats were exposed to novel environments, the responses of the two cell types were inconsistent relative to each other. This pattern suggests that current perceptions and expectations of familiar spatial contexts may dynamically modulate the relationship between hippocampus and dorsal striatum.},

	abstract = {THERE is an emerging consensus that retrosplenial and posterior parietal cortex importantly contribute to navigation. Several theories of navigation have argued that these cortical areas, particularly retrosplenial cortex, are involved in path integration. In an effort to characterize the role of retrosplenial cortex in active navigation, the effects of temporary inactivation of retrosplenial cortex on spatial memory performance were evaluated in light and dark testing conditions. Inactivation of retrosplenial cortex selectively resulted in behavioral impairments when animals were tested in darkness. These data support the hypothesis that retrosplenial cortex contributes to navigation in darkness, perhaps by providing mnemonic associations of the visual and nonvisual environment that can be used to correct for cumulative errors that occur during path integration.},

Recently, it has been proposed that animals might combine conﬂicting cues optimally using a ring attractor network architecture inspired by the head direction system in rats and augmented with a dynamic re-weighting mechanism. In this work we report that an older and simpler ring attractor network architecture, requiring no re-weighting property combines cues according to their certainty for small to moderate cue conﬂicts but converges on the most certain cue for larger conﬂicts. These results are consistent with observations in animal experiments that show sub-optimal cue integration and switching from cue integration to cue selection strategies. This work therefore demonstrates an alternative architecture for those seeking neural correlates of sensory integration in animals. In addition, performance is shown robust to noise and miniaturization and thus provides an eﬃcient solution for artiﬁcial systems.},

A population of cells called compass neurons represents a fruitfly's heading direction. Kim et al. used imaging and optogenetics in behaving flies to elucidate the functional architecture of the underlying neuronal network. They observed local excitation and global inhibition between the compass neurons. The features of the network were best explained by a ring attractor network model. Until now, this hypothesized network structure has been difficult to demonstrate in a real brain.
Science, this issue p. 849
Ring attractors are a class of recurrent networks hypothesized to underlie the representation of heading direction. Such network structures, schematized as a ring of neurons whose connectivity depends on their heading preferences, can sustain a bump-like activity pattern whose location can be updated by continuous shifts along either turn direction. We recently reported that a population of fly neurons represents the animal’s heading via bump-like activity dynamics. We combined two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed flying flies with optogenetics to overwrite the existing population representation with an artificial one, which was then maintained by the circuit with naturalistic dynamics. A network with local excitation and global inhibition enforces this unique and persistent heading representation. Ring attractor networks have long been invoked in theoretical work; our study provides physiological evidence of their existence and functional architecture.
A neuronal network in the fly brain uses global inhibition and local excitation to enforce an internal representation of heading direction.

	abstract = {Animal navigation is accomplished by a combination of landmark-following and dead reckoning based on estimates of self motion. Both of these approaches require the encoding of heading information, which can be represented as an allocentric or egocentric azimuthal angle. Recently, Ca2+ correlates of landmark position and heading direction, in egocentric coordinates, were observed in the ellipsoid body (EB), a ring-shaped processing unit in the fly central complex (Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015). These correlates displayed key dynamics of so-called ring attractors, namely: 1) responsiveness to the position of external stimuli, 2) persistence in the absence of external stimuli, 3) locking onto a single external stimulus when presented with two competitors, 4) stochastically switching between competitors with low probability, and 5) sliding or jumping between positions when an external stimulus moves. We hypothesized that ring attractor-like activity in the EB arises from reciprocal neuronal connections to a related structure, the protocerebral bridge (PB). Using recent light-microscopy resolution catalogues of neuronal cell types in the PB (Wolff et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2013), we determined a connectivity matrix for the PB-EB circuit. When activity in this network was simulated using a leaky-integrate-and-fire model, we observed patterns of activity that closely resemble the reported Ca2+ phenomena. All qualitative ring attractor behaviors were recapitulated in our model, allowing us to predict failure modes of the putative PB-EB ring attractor and the circuit dynamics phenotypes of thermogenetic or optogenetic manipulations. Ring attractor dynamics emerged under a wide variety of parameter configurations, even including non-spiking leaky-integrator implementations. This suggests that the ring-attractor computation is a robust output of this circuit, apparently arising from its high-level network properties (topological configuration, local excitation and long-range inhibition) rather than fine-scale biological detail.},

	abstract = {Continuous attractor models of working-memory store continuous-valued information in continuous state-spaces, but are sensitive to noise processes that degrade memory retention. Short-term synaptic plasticity of recurrent synapses has previously been shown to affect continuous attractor systems: short-term facilitation can stabilize memory retention, while short-term depression possibly increases continuous attractor volatility. However, it currently remains unclear to which degree these two short-term plasticity mechanisms interact, what their combined quantitative effect on working memory stability is, and whether these effects persist in neuronal networks with spike-based transmission. Here, we present a comprehensive description of the effects of short-term plasticity on noise-induced memory degradation in one-dimensional continuous attractor models. Our theoretical description, applicable to spiking and rate-based models alike, accurately describes the slow dynamics of stored memory positions in separate processes of diffusion due to spiking variability and drift due to sparse connectivity and neuronal heterogeneity. We find that facilitation decreases both diffusion and directed drifts, while short-term depression tends to increase both. Using mutual information, we evaluate the combined impact of short-term facilitation and depression on the ability of networks to retain stable working memory. Finally, our theory establishes links to experiments: we are able to predict the sensitivity of continuous working memory to distractor inputs and place constraints on network and synapse properties necessary to implement stable working memory.},

Among these are the roles of medial versus lateral posterior parietal cortex; cholinergic mechanisms in attention; interhemispheric interactions; the role of synchronous firing at the cortical, striatal, and thalamic levels; interactions between cortical and thalamic projections to the striatum; interactions between cortical and nigral inputs to the thalamus; the role of collicular inputs to the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus; the role of cerebral cortex versus superior colliculus in driving the motor output expressed as orienting behavior during directed attention; the extent to which the circuitry we describe for directed attention also plays a role in other forms of attention.},

In the egocentric task, the relative position of the starting point and the platform was constant all over training. Parietal rats have been found impaired in acquisition and to a less extent in retention of this task. In the allocentric task, rats were then trained in the standard version of the navigation task. A mild deficit was observed in acquisition of this task because the APC-lesioned rats displayed longer escape latencies but control-like search patterns. These results suggest that the APC is involved in the coding of kinesthetic information that plays an important role in place navigation.

Quick and efficient traversal of learned routes is critical to the survival of many animals. Routes can be defined by both the ordering of navigational epochs, such as continued forward motion or execution of a turn, and the distances separating them. The neural substrates conferring the ability to fluidly traverse complex routes are not well understood, but likely entail interactions between frontal, parietal, and rhinal cortices and the hippocampus. This paper demonstrates that posterior parietal cortical neurons map both individual and multiple navigational epochs with respect to their order in a route. In direct contrast to spatial firing patterns of hippocampal neurons, parietal neurons discharged in a place- and direction-independent fashion. Parietal route maps were scalable and versatile in that they were independent of the size and spatial configuration of navigational epochs. The results provide a framework in which to consider parietal function in spatial cognition.},

Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are important elements of the neural circuit for space, but whether representations in these areas are controlled by the same factors is unknown. We recorded single units simultaneously in PPC and MEC of freely foraging rats and found that a subset of PPC cells are tuned to specific modes of movement irrespective of the animals' location or heading, whereas grid cells in MEC expressed static spatial maps. The behavioral correlates of PPC cells switched completely when the same animals ran in a spatially structured maze or when they ran similar stereotypic sequences in an open arena. Representations in PPC were similar in identical mazes in different rooms where grid cells completely realigned their firing fields. The data suggest that representations in PPC are determined by the organization of actions while cells in MEC are driven by spatial inputs.},

	abstract = {A central feature of theories of spatial navigation involves the representation of spatial relationships between objects in complex environments. The parietal cortex has long been linked to the processing of spatial visual information and recent evidence from single unit recording in rodents suggests a role for this region in encoding egocentric and world-centered frames. The rat parietal cortex can be subdivided into up to four distinct rostral-caudal and medial-lateral regions, which includes a zone previously characterized as secondary visual cortex. At present, very little is known regarding the relative connectivity of these parietal subdivisions. Thus, we set out to map the connectivity of the entire anterior-posterior and medial-lateral span of this region. To do this we used anterograde and retrograde tracers in conjunction with open source neuronal segmentation and tracer detection tools to generate whole brain connectivity maps of parietal inputs and outputs. Our present results show that inputs to the parietal cortex varied significantly along the medial-lateral, but not the rostral-caudal axis. Specifically, retrosplenial connectivity is greater medially, but connectivity with visual cortex, though generally sparse, is more significant laterally. Finally, based on connection density, the connectivity between parietal cortex and hippocampus is indirect and likely achieved largely via dysgranular retrosplenial cortex. Thus, similar to primates, the parietal cortex of rats exhibits a difference in connectivity along the medial-lateral axis, which may represent functionally distinct areas.},

The present experiments monitored HD cell activity when rats were confronted with a situation in which directional information from internal sensory sources (e.g., proprioceptive, vestibular, or motor efference copy) conflicted with directional information derived from familiar, external landmarks. Results showed that when a salient, familiar cue was reintroduced to rat's environment into a position that conflicted with the cell's current firing direction, HD cells in both the ATN and the postsubiculum shifted their preferred direction to reflect their originally established orientation with this cue. This finding suggests that sensory inputs onto HD cells from external landmark cues are capable of overriding spatial information developed through internal sensory cues.},

	abstract = {Head direction (HD) and place cells were recorded in rats that had previously exhibited significant acquisition deficits on a radial arm maze task following disorientation treatment. In this study we determined whether this behavioral impairment was associated with a lack of landmark stimulus control over the preferred orientations of HD and place cells. Neurons were recorded as animals retrieved food pellets in a cylindrical apparatus containing a single cue card. Some of these HD cells were also recorded while animals explored an eight-arm radial maze in a similar cue-controlled environment. The stimulus control of the landmarks in each environment was assessed by rotating the landmark and examining the subsequent preferred orientations of HD and place cells. Animals underwent disorientation treatment before and after each recording session. Despite this disorientation, rotation of the cue card in the cylindrical apparatus resulted in a corresponding shift in the preferred orientations of HD and place cells in 13 of 15 and 7 of 7 recording sessions, respectively. On the radial arm maze, rotation of the landmark cue was associated with a corresponding shift in the HD cell's preferred orientation in 7 of 9 sessions. These results suggest that a visual landmark's stimulus control may not require a learned association between that landmark and an animal's stable experience in an environment. Furthermore, instability in the HD cell system is unlikely to account for the impaired performance of the disoriented animals in the radial arm maze. Rather, these impairments may be due to the animal's inability to utilize stable representations of the environment provided by HD and place cells.},

Hippocampal neurons show selectivity with respect to visual cues in primates, including humans, but this has never been found in rodents. To address this long-standing discrepancy, we measured hippocampal activity from rodents during real-world random foraging. Surprisingly, ∼25\% of neurons exhibited significant directional modulation with respect to visual cues. To dissociate the contributions of visual and vestibular cues, we made similar measurements in virtual reality, in which only visual cues were informative. Here, we found significant directional modulation despite the severe loss of vestibular information, challenging prevailing theories of directionality. Changes in the amount of angular information in visual cues induced corresponding changes in head-directional modulation at the neuronal and population levels. Thus, visual cues are sufficient for—and play a predictable, causal role in—generating directionally selective hippocampal responses. These results dissociate hippocampal directional and spatial selectivity and bridge the gap between primate and rodent studies.},

	abstract = {Effective navigation depends upon reliable estimates of head direction (HD). Visual, vestibular, and outﬂow motor signals combine for this purpose in a brain system that includes dorsal tegmental nucleus, lateral mammillary nuclei, anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus, and the postsubiculum. Learning is needed to combine such different cues to provide reliable estimates of HD. A neural model is developed to explain how these three types of signals combine adaptively within the above brain regions to generate a consistent and reliable HD estimate, in both light and darkness, which explains the following experimental facts. Each HD cell is tuned to a preferred head direction. The cell’s ﬁring rate is maximal at the preferred direction and decreases as the head turns from the preferred direction. The HD estimate is controlled by the vestibular system when visual cues are not available. A well-established visual cue anchors the cell’s preferred direction when the cue is in the animal’s ﬁeld of view. Distal visual cues are more effective than proximal cues for anchoring the preferred direction. The introduction of novel cues in either a novel or familiar environment can gain control over a cell’s preferred direction within minutes. Turning out the lights or removing all familiar cues does not change the cell’s ﬁring activity, but it may accumulate a drift in the cell’s preferred direction. The anticipated time interval (ATI) of the HD estimate is greater in early processing stages of the HD system than at later stages. The model contributes to an emerging uniﬁed neural model of how multiple processing stages in spatial navigation, including postsubiculum head direction cells, entorhinal grid cells, and hippocampal place cells, are calibrated through learning in response to multiple types of signals as an animal navigates in the world.

	abstract = {Many animals navigate using a combination of visual landmarks and path integration. In mammalian brains, head direction cells integrate these two streams of information by representing an animal's heading relative to landmarks, yet maintaining their directional tuning in darkness based on self-motion cues. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed flies walking on a ball in a virtual reality arena to demonstrate that landmark-based orientation and angular path integration are combined in the population responses of neurons whose dendrites tile the ellipsoid body — a toroidal structure in the center of the fly brain. The population encodes the fly's azimuth relative to its environment, tracking visual landmarks when available and relying on self-motion cues in darkness. When both visual and self-motion cues are absent, a representation of the animal's orientation is maintained in this network through persistent activity — a potential substrate for short-term memory. Several features of the population dynamics of these neurons and their circular anatomical arrangement are suggestive of ring attractors — network structures proposed to support the function of navigational brain circuits.},

This is accomplished by the head direction system, whose neurons – head direction cells – encode specific head directions. When the brain integrates information in sensory domains, this process is almost always ‘optimal’ – that is, inputs are weighted according to their reliability. Evidence suggests cue combination by head direction cells may also be optimal. The simplicity of the head direction signal, together with the detailed knowledge we have about the anatomy and physiology of the underlying circuit, therefore makes this system a tractable model with which to discover how optimal cue combination occurs at a neural level. In the head direction system, cue interactions are thought to occur on an attractor network of interacting head direction neurons, but attractor dynamics predict a winner-take-all decision between cues, rather than optimal combination. However, optimal cue combination in an attractor could be achieved via plasticity in the feedforward connections from external sensory cues (i.e. the landmarks) onto the ring attractor. Short-term plasticity would allow rapid re-weighting that adjusts the final state of the network in accordance with cue reliability (reflected in the connection strengths), while longer term plasticity would allow long-term learning about this reliability. Although these principles were derived to model the head direction system, they could potentially serve to explain optimal cue combination in other sensory systems more generally.},

Here we characterised a large set of landmarks along a range of features that included size, visual salience, navigational utility, and permanence. When human participants viewed images of these single landmarks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) were both engaged by landmark features, but in different ways. PHC responded to a range of landmark attributes, while RSC was engaged by only the most permanent landmarks. Furthermore, when participants were divided into good and poor navigators, the latter were significantly less reliable at identifying the most permanent landmarks, and had reduced responses in RSC and anterodorsal thalamus when viewing such landmarks. The RSC has been widely implicated in navigation but its precise role remains uncertain. Our findings suggest that a primary function of the RSC may be to process the most stable features in an environment, and this could be a prerequisite for successful navigation.},

	abstract = {How the brain combines information from different sensory modalities and of differing reliability is an important and still-unanswered question. Using the head direction (HD) system as a model, we explored the resolution of conflicts between landmarks and background cues. Sensory cue integration models predict averaging of the two cues, whereas attractor models predict capture of the signal by the dominant cue. We found that a visual landmark mostly captured the HD signal at low conflicts: however, there was an increasing propensity for the cells to integrate the cues thereafter. A large conflict presented to naive rats resulted in greater visual cue capture (less integration) than in experienced rats, revealing an effect of experience. We propose that weighted cue integration in HD cells arises from dynamic plasticity of the feed-forward inputs to the network, causing within-trial spatial redistribution of the visual inputs onto the ring. This suggests that an attractor network can implement decision processes about cue reliability using simple architecture and learning rules, thus providing a potential neural substrate for weighted cue integration.},

	abstract = {Place cells of the hippocampal formation encode a spatial representation of the environment, and the orientation of this representation is apparently governed by the head direction cell system. The representation of a well-explored environment by CA1 place cells can be split when there is conflicting information from salient proximal and distal cues, as some place fields rotate to follow the distal cues while others rotate to follow the proximal cues (Knierim, 2002a). In contrast, the CA3 representation is more coherent than CA1, as the place fields in CA3 tend to rotate in the same direction (Lee et al., 2004). The present study tests whether the head direction cell network produces a split representation or remains coherent under these conditions, by simultaneously recording both CA1 place cell and head direction cells from the thalamus. In agreement with earlier studies, split representations of the environment were observed in ensembles of CA1 place cells in about 75\% of the mismatch sessions, in which some fields followed the counterclockwise rotation of proximal cues and other fields followed the clockwise rotation of distal cues. However, out of 225 recording sessions, there was not a single instance of the head direction cell ensembles revealing a split representation of head direction. Instead, in most of the mismatch sessions the head direction cell tuning curves rotated as an ensemble clockwise (94\%) and in a few sessions rotated counterclockwise (6\%). The findings support the notion that the head direction cells may be part of an attractor network bound more strongly to distal landmarks than proximal landmarks, even under conditions in which the CA1 place representation loses its coherence.},

	abstract = {Rats were tested in place finding tasks in a rectangular environment with distinct featural panels in the corners, such as the example in Figure IA. When given a target place to seek, they made a systematic error both in a working memory paradigm and in a reference memory paradigm: they sometimes searched at the point located at 180” rotation from the target through the centre. In a working memory paradigm, these rotational errors were almost as numerous as correct searches. The target and its rotational equivalent have the same geometric relations to the arrangement of surfaces as surfaces, or the shape of the environment, but differ in their relations to non-geometric properties such as the brightness or texture of a surface. In making systematic rotational errors, the animal must have been using some record specifying only the target’s geometric relations to the shape of the environment, and not its relations to the arrangement of non-geometric information. Further tests showed that rats could use the non-geometric information, but that they primarily checked features near a geometrically specified target address, that is, an address specified by its geometric relations to the shape of the environment alone. They did not seem to use the overall arrangement of non-geometric features. It is theorized that in orienting in space by using landmarks, the rat uses primarily a purely geometric module, which also serves as a basis for coordinating the locations of non-geometric data.},

Head-direction cells preferentially discharge when the head points in a particular azimuthal direction, are hypothesized to collectively function as a single neural system for a unitary direction sense, and are believed to be essential for navigating extra-personal space by functioning like a compass. We tested these ideas by recording medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) head-direction cells while rats navigated on a familiar, continuously rotating disk that dissociates the environment into two spatial frames: one stationary and one rotating. Head-direction cells degraded directional tuning referenced to either of the externally referenced spatial frames, but firing rates, sub-second cell-pair action potential discharge relationships, and internally referenced directional tuning were preserved. MEC head-direction cell ensemble discharge collectively generates a subjective, internally referenced unitary representation of direction that, unlike a compass, is inconsistently registered to external landmarks during navigation. These findings indicate that MEC-based directional information is subjectively anchored, potentially providing for navigation without a stable externally anchored direction sense.},

We propose that all observed spatial tuning patterns – in both their selectivity and their invariance – arise from the same mechanism: Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity that is driven by the spatial tuning statistics of synaptic inputs. Using simulations and a mathematical analysis, we show that combined excitatory and inhibitory plasticity can lead to localized, grid-like or invariant activity. Combinations of diﬀerent input statistics along diﬀerent spatial dimensions reproduce all major spatial tuning patterns observed in rodents. The model is robust to changes in parameters, develops patterns on behavioral timescales and makes distinctive experimental predictions.},

The development of neural circuits constituting the head-direction system is poorly understood. Inspired by electrophysiological experiments about the role of recurrent synaptic connections, we investigate a learning rule that teaches neurons to amplify feed-forward inputs. We simulate random head movements of a rat, during which neurons receive both visual and vestibular (head-velocity) inputs. Remarkably, as recurrent connections learn to amplify exclusively the visual inputs, a neural network emerges that performs spatio-temporal integration. That is, during head movements in darkness, neurons resemble HD cells by maintaining a fixed tuning to head direction. The proposed learning rule exhibits similarities with known forms of anti-Hebbian synaptic plasticity. We conclude that selective amplification could serve as a general principle for the synaptic development of multimodal feedback circuits in the brain.},

Sensory experience plays an instructive role in the development of the nervous system. Here we showed that visual experience can induce persistent modification of developing retinotectal circuits via spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Pairing light stimuli with spiking of the tectal cell induced persistent enhancement or reduction of light-evoked responses, with a dependence on the relative timing between light stimulus and postsynaptic spiking similar to that for STDP. Using precisely timed sequential three-bar stimulation to mimic a moving bar, we showed that spike timing-dependent LTP/LTD can account for the asymmetric modification of the tectal cell receptive field induced by moving bar. Furthermore, selective inhibition of signaling mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide, which are respectively required for light-induced LTP and LTD, interfered with moving bar-induced temporally specific changes in the tectal cell responses. Together, these findings suggest that STDP can mediate sensory experience-dependent circuit refinement in the developing nervous system.},

	abstract = {When rodents engage in irregular foraging in an open field environment, hippocampal principal cells exhibit place-specific firing that is statistically independent of the direction of traverse through the place field. When the path is restricted to a track, however, in-field rates differ substantially in opposite directions. Frequently, the representations of the track in the two directions are essentially orthogonal. We show that this directionally selective firing is not hard-wired, but develops through experience-dependent plasticity. During the rats’ first pass in each direction, place fields were highly directionally symmetric, whereas over subsequent laps, the firing rates in the two directions gradually but substantially diverged. We conclude that, even on a restricted track, place cell firing is initially determined by allocentric position, and only later, the within-field firing rates change in response to differential sensory information or behavioral cues in the two directions. In agreement with previous data, place fields near local cues, such as textures on the track, developed less directionality than place fields on a uniform part of the track, possibly because the local cues reduced the net difference in sensory input at a given point. Directionality also developed in an open environment without physical restriction of the animal’s path, when rats learned to run along a specified path. In this case, directionality developed later than on the running track, only after the rats began to run in a stereotyped manner. Although the average population firing rates exhibited little if any change over laps in either direction, the direction-specific firing rates in a given place field were up- or down-regulated with about equal probability and magnitude, which was independent in the two directions, suggesting some form of competitive mechanism (e.g., LTP/LTD) acting coherently on the set of synapses conveying external information to each cell.},

The head direction cell system is composed of multiple regions associated with the hippocampal formation. The dynamics of head direction tuning curves (HDTCs) were compared with those of hippocampal place fields. In both familiar and cue-altered environments, as a rat ran an increasing number of laps on a track, the center of mass (COM) of the HDTC tended to shift backward, similar to shifting observed in place cells. However, important differences existed between these cells in terms of the shift patterns relative to the cue-altered conditions, the proportion of backward versus forward shifts, and the time course of shift resetting. The demonstration of backward COM shifts in head direction cells and place cells suggests that similar plasticity mechanisms (such as temporally asymmetric LTP induction or spike timing-dependent plasticity) may be at work in both brain systems, and these processes may reflect a general mechanism for storing learned sequences of neural activity patterns.},

Lesions of the entire vestibular labyrinth have previously been shown to severely alter VIIIth nerve input and disrupt these HD signals. To assess the specific contributions of the semicircular canals without altering tonic VIIIth nerve input, ADN cells were recorded from chinchillas following bilateral semicircular canal occlusion. While ADN HD cells (and also hippocampal place cells and theta cells) were identified in intact chinchillas, no direction-specific activity was seen following canal occlusions. Instead, “bursty” cells were observed that exhibited burst-firing patterns similar to normal HD cells, but with firing unrelated to the animal’s actual head direction. Importantly, when pairs of bursty cells were recorded, the temporal order of their firing was dependent upon the animal’s turning direction, as is the case for pairs of normal HD cells. These results suggest that bursty cells are actually disrupted HD cells. The present findings further suggest that the HD cell network is still able to generate spiking activity following canal occlusions, but the semicircular canal input is critical for updating the network activity in register with changes in the animal’s HD.},

	abstract = {The hippocampal formation is essential for forming declarative representations of the relationships among multiple stimuli. The rodent hippocampal formation, including the entorhinal cortex and subicular complex, is critical for spatial memory. Two classes of hippocampal neurons fire in relation to spatial features. Place cells collectively map spatial locations, with each cell firing only when the animal occupies that cell’s “place field,” a particular subregion of the larger environment. Head direction (HD) cells encode directional heading, with each HD cell firing when the rat’s head is oriented in that cell’s particular “preferred firing direction.” Both landmarks and internal cues (e.g., vestibular, motor efference copy) influence place and HD cell activity. However, as is the case for navigation, landmarks are believed to exert greater influence over place and HD cell activity. Here we show that temporary inactivation of the vestibular system led to the disruption of location-specific firing in hippocampal place cells and direction-specific discharge of postsubicular HD cells, without altering motor function. Place and HD cell activity recovered over a time course similar to that of the restoration of vestibular function. These results indicate that vestibular signals provide an important influence over the expression of hippocampal spatial representations, and may explain the navigational deficits of humans with vestibular dysfunction.},

	abstract = {The rat limbic system contains a variety of location (place and grid) cells and directional (head direction; HD) cells, thought to be critical for navigation. The HD cells can be found throughout many portions of the hippocampal formation, as well as additional limbic cortical and subcortical regions. These HD-containing regions are generally strongly interconnected anatomically. Earlier work, along with theoretical considerations, suggest that despite the ubiquitous presence of HD cells, there may be a single region which is critical for the initial formation of this HD signal. Speciﬁcally, it has been suggested that the critical HD cell network resides in a reciprocal loop formed by the interconnected lateral mammillary nucleus and dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden. Unlike the HD cells, place cells have not been observed in subcortical structures. They are, however, found in various forms throughout much of the hippocampal formation. Theoretical accounts of the place cells suggest that they are partly dependent on a path integration process which is, in turn, dependent on the HD cells. According to the above reasoning, lesions of the mammillary bodies should completely eliminate both HD and place/grid cells in the hippocampal formation. Here, we tested for both HD and place cell activity in various hippocampal formation sub regions following lesions of the mammillary bodies. We found that these lesions caused nearly complete elimination of the HD cell signal, but left the place cell signal largely intact. Our interpretation of these ﬁndings is somewhat limited by the fact that we did not provide a thorough test of the path integration abilities of the post lesion place cells. These ﬁndings pose a challenge for current theoretical accounts of place and grid cells. They also help to explain the role played by the mammillary bodies in spatial learning and memory.

	abstract = {The retrosplenial cortex (RSP), a brain region frequently linked to processes of spatial navigation, contains neurons that discharge as a function of a rat's head direction (HD). HD cells have been identified throughout the limbic system including the anterodorsal thalamus (ADN) and postsubiculum (PoS), both of which are reciprocally connected to the RSP. The functional relationship between HD cells in the RSP and those found in other limbic regions is presently unknown, but given the intimate connectivity between the RSP and regions such as the ADN and PoS, and the reported loss of spatial orientation in rodents and humans with RSP damage, it is likely that the RSP plays an important role in processing the limbic HD signal. To test this hypothesis, we produced neurotoxic or electrolytic lesions of the RSP and recorded HD cells in the ADN of female Long–Evans rats. HD cells remained present in the ADN after RSP lesions, but the stability of their preferred firing directions was significantly reduced even in the presence of a salient visual landmark. Subsequent tests revealed that lesions of the RSP moderately impaired landmark control over the cells' preferred firing directions, but spared the cells directional stability when animals were required to update their orientation using self-movement cues. Together, these results suggest that the RSP plays a prominent role in processing landmark information for accurate HD cell orientation and may explain the poor directional sense in humans that follows damage to the RSP.},

Head direction (HD) cells are neurons that encode allocentric head direction, independent of the animal’s location or behavior, and are influenced by manipulations of visual landmarks. The present study determined whether the POR plays a role in processing environmental information within the HD circuit. Experiment 1 tested the role of the POR in processing visual landmark cues in the HD system during manipulation of a visual cue. HD cells from POR lesioned animals had similar firing properties, shifted their preferred firing direction following rotation of a salient visual cue, and in darkness had preferred firing directions that drifted at the same rate as controls. Experiment 2 tested the POR’s involvement in contextual fear conditioning, where the animal learns to associate a shock with both a tone and a context in which the shock was given. In agreement with previous studies, POR lesioned animals were able to learn the tone-shock pairing, but displayed less freezing relative to controls when reintroduced into the environment previously paired with a shock. Therefore, HD cells from POR lesioned animals, with demonstrated impairments in contextual fear conditioning, were able to use a visual landmark to control their preferred direction. Thus, despite its importance in processing visual landmark information in primates, the POR in rats does not appear to play a pivotal role in controlling visual landmark information in the HD system.},

Two cortical regions that are connected to primary visual areas, postsubiculum (PoS) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), possess HD cells: we investigated whether they differ in how they process visual landmarks.
Methods: We compared PoS and RSC HD cell activity from tetrode-implanted rats exploring an arena in which correct HD orientation required discrimination of two opposing landmarks having high, moderate or low discriminability.
Results: RSC HD cells had higher firing rates than PoS HD cells and slightly lower modulation by angular head velocity, and anticipated actual head direction by {\textasciitilde}48 ms, indicating that RSC spiking leads PoS spiking. Otherwise, we saw no differences in landmark processing, in that HD cells in both regions showed equal responsiveness to and discrimination of the cues, with cells in both regions having unipolar directional tuning curves and showing better discrimination of the highly discriminable cues. There was a small spatial component to the signal in some cells, consistent with their role in interacting with the place cell navigation system, and there was also slight modulation by running speed. Neither region showed theta modulation of HD cell spiking.
Conclusions: That the cells can immediately respond to subtle differences in spatial landmarks is consistent with rapid processing of visual snapshots or scenes; similarities in PoS and RSC responding may be due either to similar computations being performed on the visual inputs, or to rapid sharing of information between these regions. More generally, this two-cue HD cell paradigm may be a useful method for testing rapid spontaneous visual discrimination capabilities in other experimental settings.},

	abstract = {Injury to the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) may affect both hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex thus explaining some parallels between diencephalic and medial temporal lobe amnesias. We found that standard-housed rats with ATN lesions, compared with standard-housed controls, showed reduced spine density in hippocampal CA1 neurons (basal dendrites, 211.2\%; apical dendrites, 29.6\%) and in retrospenial granular b cortex (Rgb) neurons (apical dendrites, 220.1\%) together with spatial memory deﬁcits on cross maze and radial-arm maze tasks. Additional rats with ATN lesions were also shown to display a severe deﬁcit on spatial working memory in the cross-maze, but subsequent enriched housing ameliorated their performance on both this task and the radial-arm maze. These enriched rats with ATN lesions also showed recovery of both basal and apical CA1 spine density to levels comparable to that of the standard-housed controls, but no recovery of Rgb spine density. Inspection of spine types in the CA1 neurons showed that ATN lesions reduced the density of thin spines and mushroom spines, but not stubby spines; while enrichment promoted recovery of thin spines. Comparison with enriched rats that received pseudo-training, which provided comparable task-related experience, but no explicit spatial memory training, suggested that basal CA1 spine density in particular was associated with spatial learning and memory performance. Distal pathology in terms of reduced integrity of hippocampal and retrosplenial microstructure provides clear support for the inﬂuence of the ATN lesions on the extended hippocampal system. The reversal by postoperative enrichment of this deﬁcit in the hippocampus but not the retrosplenial cortex may indicate region-speciﬁc mechanisms of recovery after ATN injury.

Many cells within the postsubiculum and anterior thalamus discharge as a function of the animal’s head direction (HD), while many cells in the hippocampus discharge in relation to the animal’s location. We placed lesions in the hippocampus and recorded from HD cells in the postsubiculum and anterior thalamus. Lesions of the hippocampus did not disrupt the HD cell signal in either brain area, indicating that the HD cell signal must be generated by structures external to the hippocampus. In addition, each cell’s preferred firing direction remained stable across days when the lesioned animal was placed into a novel environment. This stability appeared to weaken after several weeks of nonexposure to the new enclosure for two out of five animals, and subsequently recorded cells from these two animals established a new angular relationship between the familiar and novel environments. Our results suggest that extrahippocampal structures are capable of creating and maintaining a novel representation of the animal’s environmental context. This representation shares features in common with mnemonic processes involving episodic memory that until now were assumed to require an intact hippocampus.},

Here we correlated the structural and physiological properties of single neurons of the presubiculum in vitro. Unsupervised cluster analysis based on dendritic length and form, soma location, ﬁring pattern and action potential properties allowed us to classify principal neurons into three major cell types. Cluster 1 consisted of a population of small regular spiking principal cells in layers II/III. Cluster 2 contained intrinsically burst ﬁring pyramidal cells of layer IV, with a resting potential close to threshold. Cluster 3 included regular spiking cells of layers V and VI, and could be divided into subgroups 3.1 and 3.2. Cells of cluster 3.1 included pyramidal, multiform and inverted pyramidal cells. Cells of cluster 3.2 contained high-resistance pyramidal neurons that ﬁred readily in response to somatic current injection. These data show that presubicular principal cells generally conform to neurons of the periarchicortex. However, the presence of intrinsic bursting cells in layer IV distinguishes the presubicular cortex from the neighbouring entorhinal cortex. The ﬁring frequency adaptation was very low for principal cells of clusters 1 and 3, a property that should assist the generation of maintained head direction signals in vivo.},

Little is known about GABAergic interneurons of this region. Here, we used three transgenic mouse lines, Pvalb-Cre, Sst-Cre and X98, to examine distinct interneurons labeled with tdTomato or green fluorescent protein. The distribution of interneurons in presubicular lamina for each animal line was compared to that in the GAD67-GFP knock-in animal line. Labelling was specific in the Pvalb-Cre line with 87\% of labeled interneurons immunopositive for (PV). Immunostaining for somatostatin (SOM) revealed good specificity in the X98 line with 89\% of fluorescent cells, but a lesser specificity in Sst-Cre animals where only 71\% of labeled cells were immunopositive. A minority of {\textasciitilde} 6\% of interneurons co-expressed PV and SOM in the presubiculum of Sst-Cre animals. The electrophysiological and morphological properties of fluorescent interneurons from Pvalb-Cre, Sst-Cre and X98 mice differed. Distinct physiological groups of presubicular interneurons were resolved by unsupervised cluster analysis of parameters describing passive properties, firing patterns and AP shapes. One group consisted of SOM-positive, Martinotti type neurons with a low firing threshold (cluster 1). Fast spiking basket cells, mainly from the Pvalb-Cre line, formed a distinct group (cluster 3). Another group (cluster 2) contained interneurons of intermediate electrical properties and basket-cell like morphologies. These labeled neurons were recorded from both Sst-Cre and Pvalb-Cre animals. Thus, our results reveal a wide variation in anatomical and physiological properties for these interneurons, a real overlap of interneurons immuno-positive for both PV and SOM as well as an off-target recombination in the Sst-Cre line, possibly linked to maternal cre inheritance.},

	abstract = {Background: Visual landmarks are used by head direction (HD) cells to establish and help update the animal’s representation of head direction, for use in orientation and navigation. Two cortical regions that are connected to primary visual areas, postsubiculum (PoS) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), possess HD cells: we investigated whether they differ in how they process visual landmarks.
Methods: We compared PoS and RSC HD cell activity from tetrode-implanted rats exploring an arena in which correct HD orientation required discrimination of two opposing landmarks having high, moderate or low discriminability.
Results: RSC HD cells had higher firing rates than PoS HD cells and slightly lower modulation by angular head velocity, and anticipated actual head direction by {\textasciitilde}48 ms, indicating that RSC spiking leads PoS spiking. Otherwise, we saw no differences in landmark processing, in that HD cells in both regions showed equal responsiveness to and discrimination of the cues, with cells in both regions having unipolar directional tuning curves and showing better discrimination of the highly discriminable cues. There was a small spatial component to the signal in some cells, consistent with their role in interacting with the place cell navigation system, and there was also slight modulation by running speed. Neither region showed theta modulation of HD cell spiking.
Conclusions: That the cells can immediately respond to subtle differences in spatial landmarks is consistent with rapid processing of visual snapshots or scenes; similarities in PoS and RSC responding may be due either to similar computations being performed on the visual inputs, or to rapid sharing of information between these regions. More generally, this two-cue HD cell paradigm may be a useful method for testing rapid spontaneous visual discrimination capabilities in other experimental settings.},

	abstract = {Some neurons encode information about the orientation or position of an animal, and can maintain their response properties in the absence of visual input. Examples include head direction cells in rats and primates, place cells in rats and spatial view cells in primates. ‘Continuous attractor’ neural networks model these continuous physical spaces by using recurrent collateral connections between the neurons which reﬂect the distance between the neurons in the state space (e.g. head direction space) of the animal. These networks maintain a localized packet of neuronal activity representing the current state of the animal. We show how the synaptic connections in a one-dimensional continuous attractor network (of for example head direction cells) could be selforganized by associative learning. We also show how the activity packet could be moved from one location to another by idiothetic (self-motion) inputs, for example vestibular or proprioceptive, and how the synaptic connections could self-organize to implement this. The models described use ‘trace’ associative synaptic learning rules that utilize a form of temporal average of recent cell activity to associate the ﬁring of rotation cells with the recent change in the representation of the head direction in the continuous attractor. We also show how a nonlinear neuronal activation function that could be implemented by NMDA receptors could contribute to the stability of the activity packet that represents the current state of the animal.},

	title = {Self-organizing continuous attractor network models of hippocampal spatial view cells},
	abstract = {Single neuron recording studies have demonstrated the existence of hippocampal spatial view neurons which encode information about the spatial location at which a primate is looking in the environment. These neurons are able to maintain their firing even in the absence of visual input. The standard neuronal network approach to model networks with memory that represent continuous spaces is that of continuous attractor networks. It has recently been shown how idiothetic (self-motion) inputs could update the activity packet of neuronal firing for a one-dimensional case (head direction cells), and for a two-dimensional case (place cells which represent the place where a rat is located). In this paper, we describe three models of primate hippocampal spatial view cells, which not only maintain their spatial firing in the absence of visual input, but can also be updated in the dark by idiothetic input. The three models presented in this paper represent different ways in which a continuous attractor network could integrate a number of different kinds of velocity signal (e.g., head rotation and eye movement) simultaneously. The first two models use velocity information from head angular velocity and from eye velocity cells, and make use of a continuous attractor network to integrate this information. A fundamental feature of the first two models is their use of a Ômemory traceÕ learning rule which incorporates a form of temporal average of recent cell activity. Rules of this type are able to build associations between different patterns of neural activities that tend to occur in temporal proximity, and are incorporated in the model to enable the recent change in the continuous attractor to be associated with the contemporaneous idiothetic input. The third model uses positional information from head direction cells and eye position cells to update the representation of where the agent is looking in the dark. In this case the integration of idiothetic},

	abstract = {Motivated by experimental observations of the head direction system, we study a three population network model that operates as a continuous attractor network. This network is able to store in a short-term memory an angular variable (the head direction) as a spatial proﬁle of activity across neurons in the absence of selective external inputs, and to accurately update this variable on the basis of angular velocity inputs. The network is composed of one excitatory population and two inhibitory populations, with inter-connections between populations but no connections within the neurons of a same population. In particular, there are no excitatory-to-excitatory connections. Angular velocity signals are represented as inputs in one inhibitory population (clockwise turns) or the other (counterclockwise turns). The system is studied using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Analysis of a simpliﬁed model composed of threshold-linear neurons gives the conditions on the connectivity for (i) the emergence of the spatially selective proﬁle, (ii) reliable integration of angular velocity inputs, and (iii) the range of angular velocities that can be accurately integrated by the model. Numerical simulations allow us to study the proposed scenario in a large network of spiking neurons and compare their dynamics with that of head direction cells recorded in the rat limbic system. In particular, we show that the directional representation encoded by the attractor network can be rapidly updated by external cues, consistent with the very short update latencies observed experimentally by Zugaro et al. (2003) in thalamic head direction cells.},

Those frames represent either allocentric, egocentric or route-centric views of the environment. However combinations of either of them are often deployed. Neurophysiological studies on rats have indicated that the hippocampus, the retrosplenial cortex and the posterior parietal cortex contribute to the formation of these frames and mediate the transformation between those. In this paper, we construct a computational model of the posterior parietal cortex and the retrosplenial cortex for spatial navigation. We demonstrate how the transformation of reference frames could be realized in the brain and suggest how different brain areas might use these reference frames to form navigational strategies, and predict under what conditions an animal might use a specific type of reference frame. Our simulated navigation experiments demonstrate that the model’s results closely resemble behavioral findings in humans and rats. These results suggest that navigation strategies may depend on the animal’s reliance in a particular reference frame and shows how low confidence in a reference frame can lead to fluid adaptation and deployment of alternative navigation strategies. Because of its flexibility, our biologically inspired navigation system may be applied to autonomous robots.},

The PoS provides return projections to LMN and ADN and is responsible for the landmark control of HD cells in ADN. However, the functional role of the PoS projection to LMN has not been tested. The present study recorded HD cells from LMN after bilateral PoS lesions to determine whether the PoS provides landmark control to LMN HD cells. After the lesion and implantation of electrodes, HD cell activity was recorded while rats navigated within a cylindrical arena containing a single visual landmark or while they navigated between familiar and novel arenas of a dual-chamber apparatus. PoS lesions disrupted the landmark control of HD cells and also disrupted the stability of the preferred firing direction of the cells in darkness. Furthermore, PoS lesions impaired the stable HD cell representation maintained by path integration mechanisms when the rat walked between familiar and novel arenas. These results suggest that visual information first gains control of the HD cell signal in the LMN, presumably via the direct PoS → LMN projection. This visual landmark information then controls HD cells throughout the HD cell circuit.},

The hippocampal and parahippocampal region and the retrosplenial cortex are crucially involved in navigational processes and connections between the parahippocampal/retrosplenial domain and the posterior parietal cortex have been described. However, an integrated account of the organization of these connections is lacking. Here, we investigated parahippocampal connections of each posterior parietal subdivision and the neighboring secondary visual cortex using conventional retrograde and anterograde tracers as well as transsynaptic retrograde tracing with a modified rabies virus. The results show that posterior parietal as well as secondary visual cortex entertain overall sparse connections with the parahippocampal region but not with the hippocampal formation. The medial and lateral dorsal subdivisions of posterior parietal cortex receive sparse input from deep layers of all parahippocampal areas. Conversely, all posterior parietal subdivisions project moderately to dorsal presubiculum, whereas rostral perirhinal cortex, postrhinal cortex, caudal entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum all receive sparse posterior parietal input. This indicated that the presubiculum might be a major liaison between parietal and parahippocampal domains. In view of the close association of the presubiculum with the retrosplenial cortex, we included the latter in our analysis. Our data indicate that posterior parietal cortex is moderately connected with the retrosplenial cortex, particularly with rostral area 30. The relative sparseness of the connectivity with the parahippocampal and retrosplenial domains suggests that posterior parietal cortex is only a modest actor in forming spatial representations underlying navigation and spatial memory in parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortex. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

An associative synaptic modification rule with a short term memory trace enables preceding combination cell activity during training to be associated with the next position in the continuous attractor network.

A precise understanding of these local networks requires relating circuit activity with the underlying network structure. For pyramidal cells in superficial mouse visual cortex (V1), a consensus is emerging that neurons with similar visual response properties excite each other–, but the anatomical basis of this recurrent synaptic network is unknown. We combined physiological imaging and large-scale electron microscopy (EM) to study an excitatory network in V1. We found that layer 2/3 neurons organized into subnetworks defined by anatomical connectivity, with more connections within than between groups. More specifically, we found that pyramidal neurons with similar orientation selectivity preferentially formed synapses with each other, despite the fact that axons and dendrites of all orientation selectivities pass near ({\textless} 5 μm) each other with roughly equal probability. Therefore, we predict that mechanisms of functionally specific connectivity take place at the length scale of spines. Neurons with similar orientation tuning formed larger synapses, potentially enhancing the net effect of synaptic specificity. With the ability to study thousands of connections in a single circuit, functional connectomics is proving a powerful method to uncover the organizational logic of cortical networks.},

In this paper, we present simulation results from a model designed to explain these observations. The model accurately replicates the Knight et al. data. We suggest that cue conflict resolution is critically dependent on plastic remapping of visual information onto the HD cell layer. This remap results in a shift in preferred directions of a subset of HD cells, which is then inherited by the rest of the cells during path integration. Thus, we demonstrate how, over a period of several minutes, a visual landmark may gain cue control. Furthermore, simulation results show that weaker visual landmarks fail to gain cue control as readily. We therefore suggest a second longer term plasticity in visual projections onto HD cell areas, through which landmarks with an inconsistent relationship to idiothetic information are made less salient, significantly hindering their ability to gain cue control. Our results provide a mechanism for reliability-weighted cue averaging that may pertain to other neural systems in addition to the HD system.},

This is known as the path integration of head direction. An important question is how the head direction cell system learns to perform accurate path integration of head direction. In this paper we propose a model of velocity path integration of head direction in which the natural time delay of axonal transmission between a linked continuous attractor network and competitive network acts as a timing mechanism to facilitate the correct speed of path integration. The model effectively learns a “look-up” table for the correct speed of path integration. In simulation, we show that the model is able to successfully learn two different speeds of path integration across two different axonal conduction delays, and without the need to alter any other model parameters. An implication of this model is that, by learning look-up tables for each speed of path integration, the model should exhibit a degree of robustness to damage. In simulations, we show that the speed of path integration is not significantly affected by degrading the network through removing a proportion of the cells that signal rotational velocity.},

 addition, two red light-emitting diodes (LED) are permanently attached

 flashes reveal both the local events at each electrode site and the
 orderly transfer of visual information from retina to cortex. The major
 finding is that every stimulus, regardless of its luminance, duration,
 or the state of retinal light adaptation, elicits an optic nerve volley
 with a latency of about 10 ms and a duration of about 300 ms. This
 phenomenon has not been reported previously, so far as we are aware. We
 conclude that the retina, which originates from the forebrain of the
 developing embryo, behaves like a typical brain structure: it
 translates, within a few hundred milliseconds, the chemical information
 in each pattern of bleached photoreceptors into a corresponding pattern
 of ganglion cell neuronal information that leaves via the optic nerve.
 The attributes of each rat ganglion cell appear to include whether the
 retinal neuropile calls on it to leave after a stimulus and, if so
 when, within a 300-ms poststimulus epoch. The resulting retinal
 analysis of the scene, on arrival at the cortical level, is presumed to
 participate importantly in the creation of visual perceptual

This network requires inputs from visual landmarks to anchor the HD signal to the external world. We investigated whether information about HD and visual landmarks is integrated in the medial entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum, resulting in neurons expressing a conjunctive code for HD and visual landmarks. We found that parahippocampal HD cells could be divided into two classes based on their theta-rhythmic activity: non-rhythmic and theta-rhythmic HD cells. Manipulations of the visual landmarks caused tuning curve alterations in most HD cells, with the largest visually driven changes observed in non-rhythmic HD cells. Importantly, the tuning modifications of non-rhythmic HD cells were often non-coherent across cells, refuting the notion that attractor-like dynamics control non-rhythmic HD cells. These findings reveal a new population of non-rhythmic HD cells whose malleable organization is controlled by visual landmarks.},

	abstract = {It is surprising how quickly we can find our bearings when suddenly confronted with a familiar environment, for instance when the lights are turned on in a dark room. Subjectively, this appears to occur almost instantaneously, yet the neural processes permitting this rapid reorientation are unknown. A likely candidate is the head direction (HD) cell system. These limbic neurons found in several brain regions, including the thalamus and the hippocampus, discharge selectively when the head of an animal is oriented in a particular (“preferred”) direction. This neuronal activity is independent of position and ongoing behavior and is thus likely to constitute a physiological basis for the sense of direction. Remarkably, although the HD cell system has properties resembling those of a compass, it is independent of geomagnetic fields. Rather, the preferred directions of the HD cells are strongly anchored to visual cues in the environment. Here, we bring evidence for the first time that a fundamental component of the capacity to rapidly reorient in a familiar environment may be brought about by updating of HD cell responses as rapidly as 80 msec after changes in the visual scene. Continuous attractor networks have been used successfully to model HD cell ensemble dynamics. The present results suggest that after large rotations of the surrounding landmarks, activity in such networks may be propagated in abrupt jumps rather than in a gradually progressive manner.},

Repeated objects had lags ranging from 0 to 4 (from 0 to 4 different objects between the first and repeated presentation). An object was presented on one side of a long table divided in half by an opaque Plexiglas guillotine door, and the latency between opening the door and the rat moving the object was measured. The first presentation of an object resulted in reinforcement, but repeated presentations did not result in a reinforcement. After completion of acquisition training (significantly longer latencies for repeated presentation compared with the first presentation of an object), rats received lesions of the perirhinal, medial, or lateral entorhinal cortex or served as sham operated controls. On the basis of postsurgery testing and additional tests, the results indicated that rats with perirhinal cortex lesions had a sustained impairment in performing the task. There were no sustained deficits with medial or lateral entorhinal cortex lesions. The data suggest that recognition memory for visual object information is mediated primarily by the perirhinal cortex but not by the medial or lateral entorhinal cortex.},

	abstract = {The retrosplenial cortex is anatomically positioned to integrate sensory, motor, and visual information and is thought to have an important role in processing spatial information and guiding behavior through complex environments. Anatomical and theoretical work has argued that the retrosplenial cortex participates in spatial behavior in concert with its primary input, the parietal cortex. Although the nature of this interactions is unknown, the central position is that the functional connectivity is hierarchical with egocentric spatial information processed at parietal cortex, and higher-level allocentric mappings generated in the retrosplenial cortex. Here, we review the evidence supporting this proposal. We begin by summarizing the key anatomical features of the retrosplenial-parietal network, and then review studies investigating the neural correlates of these regions during spatial behavior. Our summary of this literature suggests that the retrosplenial-parietal circuitry does not represent a strict hierarchical parcellation of function between the two regions, but instead a heterogeneous mixture of egocentric-allocentric coding and integration across frames of reference. We also suggest that this circuitry should be represented as a gradient of egocentric-to-allocentric information processing from parietal to retrosplenial cortices, with more specialized encoding of global allocentric frameworks within the retrosplenial cortex and more specialized egocentric and local allocentric representations in parietal cortex. We conclude by identifying the major gaps in this literature and suggest new avenues of research.},

Traversal of a complicated route is often facilitated by considering it as a set of related sub-spaces. Such compartmentalization processes could occur within retrosplenial cortex, a structure whose neurons simultaneously encode position within routes and other spatial coordinate systems. Here, retrosplenial cortex neurons were recorded as rats traversed a track having recurrent structure at multiple scales. Consistent with a major role in compartmentalization of complex routes, individual retrosplenial cortex (RSC) neurons exhibited periodic activation patterns that repeated across route segments having the same shape. Concurrently, a larger population of RSC neurons exhibited single-cycle periodicity over the full route, effectively defining a framework for encoding of sub-route positions relative to the whole. The same population simultaneously provides a novel metric for distance from each route position to all others. Together, the findings implicate retrosplenial cortex in the extraction of path sub-spaces, the encoding of their spatial relationships to each other, and path integration.},

We tested these ideas by recording medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) head-direction cells while rats navigated on a familiar, continuously rotating disk that dissociates the environment into two spatial frames: one stationary and one rotating. Head-direction cells degraded directional tuning referenced to either of the externally referenced spatial frames, but ﬁring rates, sub-second cell-pair action potential discharge relationships, and internally referenced directional tuning were preserved. MEC head-direction cell ensemble discharge collectively generates a subjective, internally referenced unitary representation of direction that, unlike a compass, is inconsistently registered to external landmarks during navigation. These ﬁndings indicate that MEC-based directional information is subjectively anchored, potentially providing for navigation without a stable externally anchored direction sense.},

Here, we apply an unbiased statistical approach to search for cells that encode navigationally relevant variables. This approach successfully classiﬁes the majority of entorhinal cells and reveals unsuspected entorhinal coding principles. First, we ﬁnd a high degree of mixed selectivity and heterogeneity in superﬁcial entorhinal neurons. Second, we discover a dynamic and remarkably adaptive code for space that enables entorhinal cells to rapidly encode navigational information accurately at high running speeds.

	abstract = {The entorhinal cortex (EC) serves a pivotal role in corticohippocampal interactions, but a complete description of its extrinsic connections has not been presented. Here, we have summarized the cortical, subcortical, and hippocampal connections of the lateral entorhinal area (LEA) and the medial entorhinal area (MEA) in the rat. We found that the targets and relative strengths of the entorhinal connections are strikingly different for the LEA and MEA. For example, the LEA receives considerably heavier input from the piriform and insular cortices, whereas the MEA is more heavily targeted by the visual, posterior parietal, and retrosplenial cortices. Regarding subcortical connections, the LEA receives heavy input from the amygdala and olfactory structures, whereas the MEA is targeted by the dorsal thalamus, primarily the midline nuclei and also the dorsolateral and dorsoanterior thalamic nuclei. Differences in the LEA and MEA connections with hippocampal and parahippocampal structures are also described. In addition, because the EC is characterized by bands of intrinsic connectivity that span the LEA and MEA and project to different septotemporal levels of the dentate gyrus, special attention was paid to the efferents and afferents of those bands. Finally, we summarized the connections of the dorsocaudal MEA, the region in which the entorhinal ‘‘grid cells’’ were discovered. The subregional differences in entorhinal connectivity described here provide further evidence for functional diversity within the EC. It is hoped that these ﬁndings will inform future studies of the role of the EC in learning and memory. VC 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Estimates of neuron numbers have been useful in studies of neurodegenerative disorders, and in their animal models, and in the computational modeling of hippocampal function. Although the retrohippocampal region (presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal area) is an integral part of the hippocampal circuitry and is affected selectively in a number of disorders, estimates of neuron numbers in the rat retrohippocampal region have yet to be published. Such data are necessary ingredients for computational models of the function of this region and will also facilitate a comparison of this region in rats and primates, which will help to determine how well we may expect rat models to predict function and dysfunction in primate brains. In the present study, we used the optical fractionator to estimate the number of neurons in the rat retrohippocampal region. The following estimates were obtained: 3.3 3 105 in presubicular layers II and III, 1.5 3 105 in parasubicular layers II and III, 2.2 3 105 in the combined pre- and parasubicular layers V and VI, 6.6 3 104 in medial entorhinal area (MEA) layer II, 1.3 3 105 in MEA layer III, 1.9 3 105 in MEA layers V and VI, 4.6 3 104 in lateral entorhinal area (LEA) layer II, 1.2 3 105 in LEA layer III, and 1.4 3 105 in LEA layers V and VI. A surprising ﬁnding was the large numbers of neurons in the pre- and parasubiculum, which indicate an important role of these areas in the control of the entorhino-hippocampal projection. A comparison of the numbers of neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal areas in rats with similar estimates in humans revealed that gross input-output relations are largely conserved. Differences between rats and humans may be accounted for by more prominent entorhino-neocortical projections in primates and consequent increases in the number of neurons in the hippocampus and retrohippocampal region, which are dedicated to these projections.

	abstract = {Navigation is mediated by a network of brain areas, and research has focused on the head-direction system in the presubiculum (PrS), the grid cell containing medial entorhinal cortex (EC) (MEC) and place cells in the hippocampus. Less research addressed the interactions of the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and the navigational system, although it is well established that damage to the RSC leads to navigational deficits. We previously showed that RSC provides a dense input to deep layers of MEC and to superficial layers of PrS. In this study we use confocal microscopical analysis and show that the dense projection from the caudal part of the ventral retrosplenial granular cortex targets neurons in Layer III of PrS, which provide input to superficial layers of MEC. Our high resolution anatomical data indicate that sparsely spiny pyramidal neurons in Layer III of PrS that originate projections to Layer III of MEC are the main target of these retrosplenial projections. Retrosplenial axonal boutons were found to equally contact spines and shafts of basal dendrites in Layer III, but contacts on shafts are more prominent close to the soma, indicating the potential for efficient synaptic transfer. These observations suggest that neurons in Layer III of PrS have an important role in mediating RSC contributions to navigation. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc},

	abstract = {The parasubiculum is a major input structure of layer 2 of medial entorhinal cortex, where most grid cells are found. Here we investigated parasubicular circuits of the rat by anatomical analysis combined with juxtacellular recording/labeling and tetrode recordings during spatial exploration. In tangential sections, the parasubiculum appears as a linear structure flanking the medial entorhinal cortex mediodorsally. With a length of ∼5.2 mm and a width of only ∼0.3 mm (approximately one dendritic tree diameter), the parasubiculum is both one of the longest and narrowest cortical structures. Parasubicular neurons span the height of cortical layers 2 and 3, and we observed no obvious association of deep layers to this structure. The “superficial parasubiculum” (layers 2 and 1) divides into ∼15 patches, whereas deeper parasubicular sections (layer 3) form a continuous band of neurons. Anterograde tracing experiments show that parasubicular neurons extend long “circumcurrent” axons establishing a “global” internal connectivity. The parasubiculum is a prime target of GABAergic and cholinergic medial septal inputs. Other input structures include the subiculum, presubiculum, and anterior thalamus. Functional analysis of identified and unidentified parasubicular neurons shows strong theta rhythmicity of spiking, a large fraction of head-direction selectivity (50\%, 34 of 68), and spatial responses (grid, border and irregular spatial cells, 57\%, 39 of 68). Parasubicular output preferentially targets patches of calbindin-positive pyramidal neurons in layer 2 of medial entorhinal cortex, which might be relevant for grid cell function. These findings suggest the parasubiculum might shape entorhinal theta rhythmicity and the (dorsoventral) integration of information across grid scales.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are crucial components of an internal navigation system of the mammalian brain. The parasubiculum is a major input structure of layer 2 of MEC, where most grid cells are found. Here we provide a functional and anatomical characterization of the parasubiculum and show that parasubicular neurons display unique features (i.e., strong theta rhythmicity of firing, prominent head-direction selectivity, and output selectively targeted to layer 2 pyramidal cell patches of MEC). These features could contribute to shaping the temporal and spatial code of downstream grid cells in entorhinal cortex.},

We examined spiking rhythms and modes of synchrony between neurons participating in head direction networks for evidence of internal processing, independent of direct sensory drive, which may be important for grid cell function. We demonstrate that head direction networks of rats are segregated into at least two populations of neurons firing on alternate theta cycles (theta cycle skipping) with fixed synchronous or anti-synchronous relationships. Pairs of anti-synchronous theta cycle skipping neurons exhibited larger differences in head direction tuning with a minimum difference of 40 degrees of head direction. Septal inactivation preserved the head direction signal but eliminated theta cycle skipping of head direction cells and grid cell spatial periodicity. We propose that internal mechanisms underlying cycle skipping in head direction networks may be critical for downstream spatial computation by grid cells.},

	abstract = {The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the major input and output structure of the hippocampal formation, forming the nodal point in cortico-hippocampal circuits. Different division schemes including two or many more subdivisions have been proposed, but here we will argue that subdividing EC into two components, the lateral (LEC) and medial EC (MEC) might suffice to describe the functional architecture of EC. This subdivision then leads to an anatomical interpretation of the different phenotypes of LEC and MEC. First, we will briefly summarize the cytoarchitectonic differences and differences in hippocampal projection patterns on which the subdivision between LEC and MEC traditionally is based and provide a short comparative perspective. Second, we focus on main differences in cortical connectivity, leading to the conclusion that the apparent differences may well correlate with the functional differences. Cortical connectivity of MEC is features interactions with areas such as the presubiculum, parasubiculum, retrosplenial cortex and postrhinal cortex, all areas that are considered to belong to the ’spatial processing domain’ of the cortex. In contrast, LEC is strongly connected with olfactory areas, insular, medial- and orbitofrontal areas and perirhinal cortex. These areas are likely more involved in processing of object information, attention and motivation. Third, we will compare the intrinsic networks involving principal- and inter-neurons in LEC and MEC. Together, these observations suggest that the different phenotypes of both EC subdivisions likely depend on the combination of intrinsic organization and specific sets of inputs. We further suggest a reappraisal of the notion of EC as a layered input-output structure for the hippocampal formation.},

	abstract = {The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is thought to create and update a dynamical representation of the animal’s spatial location. Most suggestive of this process are grid cells, whose ﬁring locations occur periodically in space. Prior studies in small environments were ambiguous as to whether all spatially modulated cells in MEC were variants of grid cells or whether a subset resembled classic place cells of the hippocampus. Recordings from the dorsal and ventral MEC were performed as four rats foraged in a small square box centered inside a larger one. After 6 min, without removing the rat from the enclosure, the walls of the small box were quickly removed, leaving the rat free to continue foraging in the whole area enclosed by the larger box. The rate-responses of most recorded cells (70 out of 93 cells, including 15 of 16 putative interneurons) were considered spatially modulated based on information-theoretic analysis. A number of cells that resembled classic hippocampal place cells in the small box were revealed to be grid cells in the larger box. In contrast, other cells that ﬁred along the boundaries or corners of the small box did not show grid-cell ﬁring in the large box, but instead ﬁred along the corresponding locations of the large box. Remapping of the spatial response in the area corresponding to the small box after the removal of its walls was prominent in most spatially modulated cells. These results show that manipulation of local boundaries can exert a powerful inﬂuence on the spatial ﬁring patterns of MEC cells even when the manipulations leave global cues unchanged and allow uninterrupted, self-motion-based localization. Further, they suggest the presence of landmark-related information in MEC, which might prevent cumulative drift of the spatial representation or might reset it to a previously learned conﬁguration in a familiar environment.

Layer II (LII) of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) comprises grid cells that support spatial navigation. The firing pattern of grid cells might be explained by attractor dynamics in a network, which requires either direct excitatory connectivity between phase-specific grid cells or indirect coupling via interneurons. However, knowledge regarding local networks that support in vivo activity is incomplete. Here we identified essential components of LII networks in the MEC. We distinguished four types of excitatory neurons that exhibit cell-type-specific local excitatory and inhibitory connectivity. Furthermore, we found that LII neurons contribute to the excitation of contralateral neurons in the corresponding layer. Finally, we demonstrated that the medial septum controls excitation in the MEC via two subpopulations of long-range GABAergic neurons that target distinct interneurons in LII, thereby disinhibiting local circuits. We thus identified local connections that could support attractor dynamics and external inputs that likely govern excitation in LII.},

Here we show that running speed is represented in the firing rate of a ubiquitous but functionally dedicated population of entorhinal neurons distinct from other cell populations of the local circuit, such as grid, head-direction and border cells. These ‘speed cells’ are characterized by a context-invariant positive, linear response to running speed, and share with grid cells a prospective bias of ∼50–80 ms.

How the topography of neural circuits relates to their function remains unclear. Although topographic maps exist for sensory and motor variables, they are rarely observed for cognitive variables. Using calcium imaging during virtual navigation, we investigated the relationship between the anatomical organization and functional properties of grid cells, which represent a cognitive code for location during navigation. We found a substantial degree of grid cell micro-organization in mouse medial entorhinal cortex: grid cells and modules all clustered anatomically. Within a module, the layout of grid cells was a noisy two-dimensional lattice in which the anatomical distribution of grid cells largely matched their spatial tuning phases. This micro-arrangement of phases demonstrates the existence of a topographical map encoding a cognitive variable in rodents. It contributes to a foundation for evaluating circuit models of the grid cell network and is consistent with continuous attractor models as the mechanism of grid formation.},

	abstract = {The present study examined the areal and laminar distribution of direct projections from the anterior thalamic nuclei to the retrohippocampal region in the rat, with anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. The anteromedial nucleus (AM) projects to the temporal subiculum, medial entorhinal area, perirhinal area, and caudomedial part of the lateral entorhinal area. The interanteromedial nucleus (IAM) projects to the perirhinal area 0and the caudolateral part of the lateral entorhinal area. Furthermore, both the AM and IAM project to the temporal area 2, occipital area 1, and lateral occipital area 2. The projections from the AM and IAM to these retrohippocampal and neocortical regions terminate mainly in deep layers. The anteroventral nucleus (AV) projects to the subicular complex with a complex topographic organization. The most rostral part of the AV projects to layers I and III of the ventral presubiculum, the pyramidal cell layer of the temporal subiculum, and deep layers of the parasubiculum and medial entorhinal area. At the midrostrocaudal level of the AV, the lateral and the dorsal quadrants of the AV project, respectively, to layers I and III and to layers I and IV–VI of the ventral presubiculum, whereas the ventral and the medial quadrants project, respectively, to layers I and III and to layers I and IV–VI of the dorsal presubiculum. Furthermore, the lateral and dorsal quadrants project to the pyramidal cell layer of the temporal subiculum, whereas the ventral and medial quadrants project more septally. At the caudal third level of the AV, the dorsolateral part projects to layers I and III of the presubiculum with a patchy pattern and to the pyramidal cell layer of the septal subiculum. The anterodorsal nucleus projects mainly to deep layers of the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal area. The results show that each subdivision of the anterior thalamic nuclei projects to a distinct field in the retrohippocampal region. This suggests that each of these projections may have a distinct modulatory influence upon the activity of retrohippocampal neurons that play important roles in limbic functioning such as memory and learning proceses. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The thalamocortical projections to limbic cortex in the cat have been studied with retrograde and anterograde axonal transport techniques. Five limbic cortical areas were identified on the basis of cytoarchitecture. The five areas are the anterior limbic area, the cingular area, the dorsal and ventral retrosplenial areas, and the presubiculum. Each of these cortical areas received small injections of horseradish peroxidase, and the afferent thalamic nuclei were identified by retrograde labelling of cells. The cortical projection of each of the anterior thalamic nuclei and the lateral dorsal nucleus was determined autoradiographically. Each of the anterior thalamic nuclei and the lateral dorsal nucleus projects to limbic cortex by two pathways. One group of fibers leaves the rostral thalamus by the fornix, pierces the corpus callosum, and joins the cingulate fasciculus to reach limbic cortex. The other group travels through the lateral thalamic peduncle and internal capsule. The anterior ventral nucleus projects primarily to the dorsal retroslenial area, particularly to layer I, the deep portion of layer II, and superficial portion of layer III. Sparse projections also exist to the ventral retrosplenial area, the cingular area, and the presubiculum. Very sparse projections to the anterior limbic area are seen. The anterior dorsal nucleus projects primarily to the ventral retrosplenial area, particularly layers I, the deep portion of layer II, and superficial layer III. Sparse projections exist to the dorsal retrosplenial area and presubiculum, but apparently no projections exist to the cingular or anterior limbic area. The anterior medial nucleus projects primarily to layers I and superficial III of the ventral retrosplenial area. Sparse projections exist to each of the other limbic cortical areas. The lateral dorsal nucleus projects extensively onto limbic cortex. Prominent projections occur to layer I, the external granular layer and lamina dessicans of the presubiculum, layers I and III-IV of the dorsal retrosplenial area, and layers I, III, and IV of the cingular area. Sparse projections occur to the ventral retrosplenial area and the anterior limbic areas. Thalamocortical projections also originate in the midline and intralaminar nuclei including the central medial reuniens, rhomboid, paracentral, central lateral, and central dorsal nuclei. These data indicate that the anterior thalamic nuclei project upon limbic cortex in a complex manner. Further, the projections to limbic cortex from the anterior nuclei overlap with projections from the lateral dorsal nucleus. This overlap of thalamic projections onto limbic cortex suggests a convergence of information from nonprimary sensory systems with information from the classical limbic system.},

We analyzed 33 retrograde tract-tracing experiments distributed across the ﬁve regions. For each experiment, we estimated the total numbers, percentages, and densities of labeled cells in 36 subcortical structures and nuclei distributed across septum, basal ganglia, claustrum, amygdala, olfactory structures, thalamus, and hypothalamus. We found that the complement of subcortical inputs differs across the ﬁve regions, especially the PER and POR. The PER receives input from the reuniens, suprageniculate, and medial geniculate thalamic nuclei as well as the amygdala. Overall, the subcortical inputs to the PER were consistent with a role in perception, multimodal processing, and the formation of associations that include the motivational signiﬁcance of individual items and objects. Subcortical inputs to the POR were dominated by the dorsal thalamus, particularly the lateral posterior nucleus, a region implicated in visuospatial attention. The complement of subcortical inputs to the POR is consistent with a role in representing and monitoring the local spatial context. We also report that, in addition to the PER, the LEA and the medial band of the MEA also receive strong amygdala input. In contrast, subcortical input to the POR and the MEA lateral band includes much less amygdala input and is dominated by dorsal thalamic nuclei, particularly nuclei involved in spatial information processing. Thus, some subcortical inputs are consistent with the view that there is functional differentiation along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus, but others provide considerable integration. Overall, we conclude that the patterns of subcortical inputs to the PER, POR, and the entorhinal LEA and MEA provide further evidence for functional differentiation in the medial temporal lobe.

The hippocampus and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) are anatomically interconnected and both regions are involved in learning and memory. Previous studies indicate that the hippocampus exhibits unique firing patterns for different contexts and that RSC neurons selectively respond to cues that predict reinforcement or the need for a behavioral response, suggesting a hippocampal role in encoding contexts and an RSC role in encoding behaviorally significant cues. To test this, we simultaneously recorded hippocampal and RSC neuronal activity as rats learned to discriminate two behavioral contexts. The rats learned to approach the east arm of a plus maze for reward during the first half of each session and to approach the west arm during the second half. The ‘go east’ and ‘go west’ conditions constitute distinct behavioral contexts, which were cued by the reward location. Neurons in both regions developed highly context-specific responses as subjects learned to discriminate the contexts, but the response patterns differed in the two brain regions. Consistent with a context processing role, hippocampal neurons developed context specific responses to a variety of task stimuli and events. In contrast, RSC neurons only developed context specific responses to the reward location, which served as the context identifying cue. These results suggest that the hippocampus and RSC play distinct, but complimentary roles in mediating context appropriate memories and behaviors.},

	abstract = {In the present study we aimed to determine the topographical and laminar characteristics of cingulate projections to the parahippocampal region and hippocampal formation in the rat, using the anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and biotinylated dextranamine. The results show that all areas of the cingulate cortex project extensively to the parahippocampal region but not to the hippocampal formation. Rostral cingulate areas (infralimbic-, prelimbic cortices, rostral 1/3 of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) primarily project to the perirhinal and lateral entorhinal cortices. Projections from the remaining cingulate areas preferentially target the postrhinal and medial entorhinal cortices as well as the presubiculum and parasubiculum. At a more detailed level the projections show differences in topographical speciﬁcities according to their site of origin within the cingulate cortex suggesting the functional contribution of cingulate areas may differ at an individual level. This organization of the cingulate-parahippocampal projections relates to the overall organization of postulated parallel parahippocampal-hippocampal processing streams mediated through the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex respectively. The mid-rostrocaudal part of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex appears to be connected to both networks as well as to rostral and caudal parts of the cingulate cortex. This region may therefore responsible for integrating information across these speciﬁc networks. VC 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The organization of the laminar and topographical projections from the presubiculum to the entorhinal area was studied in the rat by anterograde labeling with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin and retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin. We found that the pattern of presubiculo-entorhinal projections differs between the superﬁcial and deep layers of the presubiculum. The superﬁcial layers (layers II and III) of the presubiculum gave rise to bilateral projections to layers I–VI of the medial entorhinal area (MEA). Many terminals were distributed in layer III, fewer in layer II and the deep portion of layer I, and many fewer terminals in the deep layers (layers V and VI) of MEA. In contrast, the deep layers (layers V and VI) of the presubiculum gave rise to ipsilateral projections to the entorhinal area. Many axon terminals were distributed in layers V and VI of MEA and the most superﬁcial portion of layer I of MEA, but very few in layers II and III. In addition, the ramiﬁcations in layer I extended to the lateral entorhinal area (LEA). Using two-dimensional unfolded maps of parahippocampal cortices, we elucidated the distinct topographical relationship in the presubiculo-entorhinal projection: 1) The septotemporal or longitudinal axis of the presubiculum corresponded to the axis on the MEA/LEA boundary, where the septal presubiculum projected toward the rhinal ﬁssure and the temporal presubiculum projected away from the ﬁssure. 2) The proximodistal axis of the presubiculum corresponded to the axis from the MEA/LEA boundary to the MEA/parasubiculum boundary that was virtually perpendicular to the MEA/LEA boundary, where the proximal portion of the presubiculum (close to the subiculum) projected to the region near the MEA/LEA boundary.

The present experiments use both retrograde and anterograde tracing techniques to characterize the afferent and efferent connections of Rga. Cortical projections to Rga originate in the ipsilateral area infraradiata, the retrosplenial agranular and granular b cortices, the ventral subiculum, and the contralateral Rga. Subcortical projections originate in the claustrum, the diagonal band of Broca, the thalamus, the midbrain raphe nuclei, and the locus coeruleus. The thalamic projections to Rga originate mainly in the anterodorsal (AD) and laterodorsal (LD) nuclei, with sparse projections arising in the anteroventral (AV) and reuniens nuclei. Each projection to Rga terminates in distinct layers of the cortex. The thalamic projection from AD terminates primarily in layers I, 111, and IV of Rga, whereas the s o n s arising from the LD nucleus have a dense terminal plexus only in layer I. The projections arising from the subiculum end predominantly in layer 11,whereas the postsubiculum projects to layers I and 111-V. Axons from the contralateral Rga form a dense terminal plexus in layers IV and V, with a smaller number of terminals in layers I and VI. Rga projects ipsilaterally to the AV and LD nuclei of the thalamus and to the anterior cingulate, retrosplenial agranular, and postsubicular cortices. Contralaterally it projects to the retrosplenial agranular and Rga cortices. Rga projections to the thalamus terminate ipsilaterally in the dorsal part of LD and bilaterally in AV. Together, these data suggest that Rga integrates thalamic with limbic information.},

	abstract = {Although the retrosplenial granular b cortex (Rgb) is situated in a critical position between the hippocampal formation and the neocortex, surprisingly few studies have examined its connections carefully. The present experiments use both anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques to characterize the connections of Rgb. The main cortical projections from Rgb are to the caudal part of the anterior cingulate cortex, area 18b, retrosplenial granular a cortex (Rga), and postsubiculum, and less dense terminal ﬁelds are present in the prelimbic and caudal occipital cortices. The major subcortical projections are to the anterior thalamic nuclei and the rostral pontine nuclei, and very small terminal ﬁelds are present in the caudal dorsomedial part of the striatum, the reuniens and reticular nuclei of the thalamus, and the mammillary bodies. Contralaterally, Rgb primarily projects to itself, i.e., homotypically, and more sparsely projects to Rga and postsubiculum. In general, the axons from Rgb terminate ipsilaterally in cortical layers I and III–V and contralaterally in layer V, with a smaller number of terminals in layers I and VI. Thalamic projections from Rgb target the anteroventral and laterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, with only a few axons terminating in the anterodorsal nucleus, the reticular nucleus, and the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus. Rgb is innervated by the anterior cingulate cortex, precentral agranular cortex, cortical area 18b, dorsal subiculum, and postsubiculum. Subcortical projections to Rgb originate mainly in the claustrum, the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca, and the anterior thalamic nuclei. These data demonstrate that, in the rat, Rgb is a major nodal point for the integration and subsequent distribution of information to and from the hippocampal formation, the midline limbic and visual cortices, and the thalamus. Thus, similarly to the entorhinal cortex, Rgb in the rat is a prominent gateway for information exchange between the hippocampal formation and other limbic areas of the brain. J. Comp.

	abstract = {Heading discrimination in optic flow stimuli was investigated in 5 humans. Flow patterns consisted of a computer generated motion sequence which showed a mixture of randomly moving and coherently-moving points. The motion of the coherently-moving fiducial points was completely determined by the changing position of the observer's simulated vantage point. Ego-rotation as well as ego-translation was simulated. Noise and fiducial points were confined to the ground plane in most experiments. In one experiment the points formed a cloud with no visible horizon. The results indicate that heading perception is robust against degradation of the flow-field by the presence of noise or by the reduction of the lifetime of the fiducial points. The results suggest that points, which move independently from the reference frame as formed by the fiducial points, are to a large extent removed from the analysis of optic flow by the visual process which derives the heading. The motion of recognizable points at infinity (like the horizon) appears to be essential for robust heading perception in the presence of ego-rotations.},

Fifty years ago, it was proposed that we steer to a goal using optic flow, the pattern of motion at the eye that specifies the direction of locomotion. However, we might also simply walk in the perceived direction of a goal. These two hypotheses normally predict the same behavior, but we tested them in an immersive virtual environment by displacing the optic flow from the direction of walking, violating the laws of optics. We found that people walked in the visual direction of a lone target, but increasingly relied on optic flow as it was added to the display. The visual control law for steering toward a goal is a linear combination of these two variables weighted by the magnitude of flow, thereby allowing humans to have robust locomotor control under varying environmental conditions.},

We introduce a novel method, termed "phase motion," for generating a stimulus that conveys a single instantaneous optic flow field, even though the stimulus is presented for an extended period of time. In this experiment, observers viewed stimulus videos and performed a forced choice heading discrimination task. For phase motion stimuli, observers made large errors in their judgments of heading direction. This suggests that instantaneous optic flow is insufficient for heading perception. These errors were mostly eliminated when the velocity of phase motion was varied over time to convey an evolving sequence of flow fields. This demonstrates that heading perception relies on the time-varying evolution of optic flow.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial navigation naturally involves translations within the horizontal plane and eye rotations about a vertical (yaw) axis to track and fixate targets of interest. Neurons in the macaque ventral intraparietal (VIP) area are known to represent heading (the direction of self-translation) from optic flow in a manner that is tolerant to rotational visual cues generated during pursuit eye movements. Previous studies have also reported that eye rotations modulate the response gain of heading tuning curves in VIP neurons. We tested the hypothesis that VIP neurons simultaneously represent both heading and horizontal (yaw) eye rotation velocity by measuring heading tuning curves for a range of rotational velocities of either real or simulated eye movements. Three findings support the hypothesis of a joint representation. First, we show that rotation velocity selectivity based on gain modulations of visual heading tuning is similar to that measured during pure rotations. Second, gain modulations of heading tuning are similar for self-generated eye rotations and visually simulated rotations, indicating that the representation of rotation velocity in VIP is multimodal, driven by both visual and extraretinal signals. Third, we show that roughly one-half of VIP neurons jointly represent heading and rotation velocity in a multiplicatively separable manner. These results provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, for a joint representation of translation direction and rotation velocity in parietal cortex and show that rotation velocity can be represented based on visual cues, even in the absence of efference copy signals.},

It was shown that the ILN/LT are involved in systems consolidation. However, whether they are necessary for memory retrieval as well remains unclear. We, therefore, used c-Fos immunohistochemistry and reversible inactivations to investigate the role of the ATN and ILN/LT in recent and remote contextual fear memory retrieval in rats. The results confirm a differential role of the ATN and ILN/LT in systems consolidation, showing the involvement of the ATN in recent but not remote memory retrieval. This study also pinpoints which specific nuclei are involved in retrieval: the anterodorsal nucleus for recent memories, and the lateral mediodorsal nucleus for remote memories. Lastly, we also show that the ATN are not involved in reconsolidation. Together, the results suggest that these nuclei provide critical feedback for successful memory retrieval and systems consolidation.},

The projection of LD to area 18b originates from cells in the caudalmost part of LD. In each cortical region, LD terminals display distinct laminar patterns. In area 18b and the adjacent Rdg cortex, the LD terminal field is in layers I, 111,and N,but in both the Rgb and Rga cortices the terminal field is located predominantly in layer I.

After thalamic injections, less than 10\% of all retrogradely labeled neurons in the upper brainstem reticular core were located at most rostral (perirubral) levels where there are virtually no cholinergic elements. Approximately 75–80\% of all HRP-positive neurons in the reticular formation were found between stereotaxic planes anterior 1 and posterior 2, in the peribrachial (PB) area of the pedunculopontine nucleus and in the laterodorsal tegmental (LDT) nucleus. The brainstem afferents to LG and PG thalamic nuclei essentially derive from PB neurons, with a small contribution from LDT cells, whereas the LP thalamic nucleus receives massive inputs from both PB and LDT brainstem nuclei. Of all HRP-positive elements visualized in the PB nucleus after an LG or a PG injection, 87\% and 73\%, respectively, were also ChAT-positive. Of all HRP-positive elements in the PB and LDT nuclei after an LP injection, 82\% and 92\%, respectively, were also ChAT-positive. The numbers of labeled neurons in the contralateral brainstem reticular nuclei reach 30\% to 50\% of the numbers found in the ipsilateral reticular formation. These findings reveal the existence of a prominent cholinergic projection from the brainstem reticular formation to the visual thalamic nuclei. Such a chemospecific projection is probably involved in phasic and tonic events of activated behavioral states.},

	abstract = {The laterodorsal (LD) nucleus of the thalamus has been considered a “higher order” nucleus that provides inputs to limbic cortical areas. Although its functions are largely unknown, it is often considered to be involved in spatial learning and memory. Here we provide evidence that LD is part of a hitherto unknown pathway for processing somatosensory information. Juxtacellular and extracellular recordings from LD neurons reveal that they respond to vibrissa stimulation with short latency (median = 7 ms) and large magnitude responses (median = 1.2 spikes/stimulus). Most neurons (62\%) had large receptive fields, responding to six and more individual vibrissae. Electrical stimulation of the trigeminal nucleus interpolaris (SpVi) evoked short latency responses (median = 3.8 ms) in vibrissa-responsive LD neurons. Labeling produced by anterograde and retrograde neuroanatomical tracers confirmed that LD neurons receive direct inputs from SpVi. Electrophysiological and neuroanatomical analyses revealed also that LD projects upon the cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, but has only sparse projections to the barrel cortex. These findings suggest that LD is part of a novel processing stream involved in spatial orientation and learning related to somatosensory cues.},

Regular neurons tend to have higher average resting rates than irregular neurons and in response to a constant angular acceleration stimulus of 16.7 deg/s2 regular neurons tended to have lower sensitivity and longer time constants than irregular cells. Some irregular neurons are more sensitive to incremental accelerations than to decremental accelerations of the same magnitude, whereas regular neurons tend to show symmetrical sensitivity.In response to sinusoidal angular acceleration stimuli (fixed frequencies) in the range 0.01–1.5 Hz, cells which fired regularly at rest tended to have smaller gain and longer phase lag re acceleration at most frequencies than irregular cells. Transfer functions were obtained for averaged data for regular and irregular neurons separately in both species.In both species there is evidence of systematic variation between neurons within each category, and this systematic variation is obscured by averaging across neurons.},

	abstract = {Recent work on the coding of spatial information in central otolith neurons has significantly advanced our knowledge of signal transformation from head-fixed otolith coordinates to space-centered coordinates during motion. In this review, emphasis is placed on the neural mechanisms by which signals generated at the bilateral labyrinths are recognized as gravity-dependent spatial information and in turn as substrate for otolithic reflexes. We first focus on the spatiotemporal neuronal response patterns (i.e. one- and two-dimensional neurons) to pure otolith stimulation, as assessed by single unit recording from the vestibular nucleus in labyrinth-intact animals. These spatiotemporal features are also analyzed in association with other electrophysiological properties to evaluate their role in the central construction of a spatial frame of reference in the otolith system. Data derived from animals with elimination of inputs from one labyrinth then provide evidence that during vestibular stimulation signals arising from a single utricle are operative at the level of both the ipsilateral and contralateral vestibular nuclei. Hemilabyrinthectomy also revealed neural asymmetries in spontaneous activity, response dynamics and spatial coding behavior between neuronal subpopulations on the two sides and as a result suggested a segregation of otolith signals reaching the ipsilateral and contralateral vestibular nuclei. Recent studies have confirmed and extended previous observations that the recovery of resting activity within the vestibular nuclear complex during vestibular compensation is related to changes in both intrinsic membrane properties and capacities to respond to extracellular factors. The bilateral imbalance provides the basis for deranged spatial coding and motor deficits accompanying hemilabyrinthectomy. Taken together, these experimental findings indicate that in the normal state converging inputs from bilateral vestibular labyrinths are essential to spatiotemporal signal transformation at the central otolith neurons during low-frequency head movements.},

	abstract = {. We studied the convergence of two afferent pairs of single vestibular neurons by selective stimulation of the horizontal semicircular canal (HC) and saccular (SAC) nerves, and the HC and utricular (UT) nerves in decerebrate cats. All recorded neurons were classified as vestibulospinal (VS), vestibulo-oculospinal (VOS) or vestibulo-ocular (VO), by antidromic stimulation from the oculomotor/trochlear nuclei and the spinal cord: neurons that could not be activated from any test sites were classified as vestibular (V) neurons. Of a total of 125 neurons activated by stimulation of the HC/SAC nerves, 21(17\%) received convergent inputs. Twelve of 21 neurons received monosynaptic excitatory inputs from both nerves. About half (9/21, 43\%) of the convergent neurons were classified as VS neurons, the majority of which descended through the ipsilateral lateral vestibulospinal tract (i-LVST). The HC/SAC convergent neurons were located in the rostral part of the descending, the medial and the caudal-ventral part of the lateral vestibular nucleus. In 80 neurons studied by stimulation of the HC/UT nerves, both inputs converged in 12 (15\%) neurons, more than half of which were VS neurons. Eight of 12 convergent neurons received excitatory inputs followed by inhibition from both the HC and UT nerves. A few convergent neurons (3/12) projected to the oculomotor/trochlear nucleus. Half of the convergent and non-convergent VS neurons descended to the spinal cord through the i-LVST, and the only one VOS convergent neuron via the medial vestibulospinal tract. Most of the convergent neurons were located in the lateral, the rostral part of the descending and medial vestibular nucleus. The percentages of HC/SAC and HC/UT convergence were half those of the posterior semicircular canal (PC), PC/SAC (33\%) and PC/UT (33\%) convergence, respectively. The convergent neurons receiving the HC and otolith inputs may contribute at least partly to the vestibulocollic reflex.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the vestibular nuclei were examined by extracellular recording in cats with high cervical spinal cord transections and were physiologically identified by their response to angular acceleration stimulation in the plane of the horizontal canal. Units which responded to horizontal canal stimulation were then tested firstly by slow constant velocity tilts and statically maintained positions in space (otolithic tests) and then by angular accelerations (canicular tests) in the plane of the left anterior-right posterior canals and in the plane of the left posterior-right anterior canals. In this way the extent of convergence from various vestibular sensory regions onto horizontal canal neurons was determined. In some cats an attempt was made to eliminate input from vestibular sensory regions contralateral to the recording site by making a midline section of the floor of the fourth ventricle from the aqueduct to the obex. Approximately one-third of the units in both sectioned and non-sectioned animals responded solely to horizontal canal stimulation. The remaining two-thirds exhibited convergence from other sensory regions in varying degrees of complexity — most responded to only one other sensory region, but some responded to stimulation of 2 or 3 other sensory regions. Approximately half of all units in both sectioned and non-sectioned animals responded to otolithic stimulation. Likewise, approximately half of all units responded to stimulation of at least on vertical canal, however, midline sectioning appeared to reduce this proportion. It is suggested that vestibular convergence is due to neural interaction within the vestibular nuclei rather than being due to spread of stimulation or being instances of unusual modes of operation of particular vestibular receptors. The comparatively negligible effect of midline section may be consistent with the hypothesis that vestibular commissural fibers convey ‘mirror image’information from vestibular receptors on the contralateral side, and that this information, in the animal with bilaterally intact labyrinths, has an enhancing or ‘sharpening’ effect.},

	abstract = {The role of intrinsic cortical connections in processing sensory input and in generating behavioral output is poorly understood. We have examined this issue in the context of the tuning of neuronal responses in cortex to the orientation of a visual stimulus. We analytically study a simple network model that incorporates both orientationselective input from the lateral geniculate nucleus and orientation-specific cortical interactions. Depending on the model parameters, the network exhibits orientation selectivity that originates from within the cortex, by a symmetrybreaking mechanism. In this case, the width of the orientation tuning can be sharp even if the lateral geniculate nucleus inputs are only weakly anisotropic. By using our model, several experimental consequences of this cortical mechanism of orientation tuning are derived. The tuning width is relatively independent of the contrast and angular anisotropy of the visual stimulus. The transient population response to changing of the stimulus orientation exhibits a slow "virtual rotation." Neuronal cross-correlations exhibit long time tails, the sign of which depends on the preferred orientations of the cells and the stimulus orientation.},

	abstract = {The cerebral cortex receives input from lower brain regions, and its function is traditionally considered to be processing that input through successive stages to reach an appropriate output1,2. However, the cortical circuit contains many interconnections, including those feeding back from higher centres3,4,5,6, and is continuously active even in the absence of sensory inputs7,8,9. Such spontaneous firing has a structure that reflects the coordinated activity of specific groups of neurons10,11,12. Moreover, the membrane potential of cortical neurons fluctuates spontaneously between a resting (DOWN) and a depolarized (UP) state11,13,14,15,16, which may also be coordinated. The elevated firing rate in the UP state follows sensory stimulation16 and provides a substrate for persistent activity, a network state that might mediate working memory17,18,19,20,21. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we reconstructed the dynamics of spontaneous activity of up to 1,400 neurons in slices of mouse visual cortex. Here we report the occurrence of synchronized UP state transitions (‘cortical flashes’) that occur in spatially organized ensembles involving small numbers of neurons. Because of their stereotyped spatiotemporal dynamics, we conclude that network UP states are circuit attractors—emergent features of feedback neural networks22 that could implement memory states or solutions to computational problems.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems have been used in many disciplines to model complex behaviors, including biological motor control, robotics, perception, economics, traffic prediction, and neuroscience. While often the unexpected emergent behavior of nonlinear systems is the focus of investigations, it is of equal importance to create goal-directed behavior (e.g., stable locomotion from a system of coupled oscillators under perceptual guidance). Modeling goal-directed behavior with nonlinear systems is, however, rather difficult due to the parameter sensitivity of these systems, their complex phase transitions in response to subtle parameter changes, and the difficulty of analyzing and predicting their long-term behavior; intuition and time-consuming parameter tuning play a major role. This letter presents and reviews dynamical movement primitives, a line of research for modeling attractor behaviors of autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems with the help of statistical learning techniques. The essence of our approach is to start with a simple dynamical system, such as a set of linear differential equations, and transform those into a weakly nonlinear system with prescribed attractor dynamics by means of a learnable autonomous forcing term. Both point attractors and limit cycle attractors of almost arbitrary complexity can be generated. We explain the design principle of our approach and evaluate its properties in several example applications in motor control and robotics.},

These output regions include the dorsal tegmental nucleus, which is part of a navigation-related system that provides a signal for directional heading. The habenula and IPN also project to the dorsal and medial Raphe nuclei, thought to be involved in mood and behavioral state regulation. Here, cells in both the habenula and IPN were recorded in freely moving rats while they foraged for food pellets. There were four major ﬁndings. First, many of the cells tended to ﬁre in sporadic bouts of relatively high versus low rates, and this may be related to intrinsic cell properties discovered during in vitro studies. Second, although these regions are connected to the direction signaling circuit, they do not, themselves demonstrate a directional signal. Third, about 10\% of the cells in the lateral habenula showed a strong correlation between rate and angular head motion. This may constitute an important, requisite input to the above-mentioned head direction circuit. Finally, many of the cells in each region showed a temporally coarse correlation with running speed, so that bouts of high frequency ﬁring coincided with episodes of higher behavioral activation. This last ﬁnding may be related to work which shows an inﬂuence of the habenula on locomotor activity, and in relation to the protective effects of exercise in relation to stress, as mediated by the Raphe nuclei.},

	abstract = {The high storage capacity of the episodic memory system relies on distinct representations for events that are separated in time and space. The spatial component of these computations includes the formation of independent maps by hippocampal place cells across environments, referred to as global remapping. Such remapping is thought to emerge by the switching of input patterns from specialized spatially selective cells in medial entorhinal cortex (mEC), such as grid and border cells. Although it has been shown that acute manipulations of mEC ﬁring patterns are sufﬁcient for inducing hippocampal remapping, it remains unknown whether specialized spatial mEC inputs are necessary for the reorganization of hippocampal spatial representations. Here, we examined remapping in rats without mEC input to the hippocampus and found that highly distinct spatial maps emerged rapidly in every individual rat. Our data suggest that hippocampal spatial computations do not depend on inputs from specialized cell types in mEC.},

	abstract = {Estimates of location or orientation can be constructed solely from sensory information representing environmental cues. In unfamiliar or sensory-poor environments, these estimates can also be maintained and updated by integrating self-motion information. However, the accumulation of error dictates that updated representations of heading direction and location become progressively less reliable over time, and must be corrected by environmental sensory inputs when available. Anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioural evidence indicates that angular and translational path integration contributes to the ﬁring of head direction cells and grid cells. We discuss how sensory inputs may be combined with self-motion information in the ﬁring patterns of these cells. For head direction cells, direct projections from egocentric sensory representations of distal cues can help to correct cumulative errors. Grid cells may beneﬁt from sensory inputs via boundary vector cells and place cells. However, the allocentric code of boundary vector cells and place cells requires consistent head-direction information in order to translate the sensory signal of egocentric boundary distance into allocentric boundary vector cell ﬁring, suggesting that the different spatial representations found in and around the hippocampal formation are interdependent. We conclude that, rather than representing pure path integration, the ﬁring of head-direction cells and grid cells reﬂects the interface between self-motion and environmental sensory information. Together with place cells and boundary vector cells they can support a coherent unitary representation of space based on both environmental sensory inputs and path integration signals.},

	abstract = {The anatomical organization of the parahipppocampal-hippocampal network indicates that it consists of different parallel circuits. Considering the topographical distribution of sensory cortical inputs, the hypothesis is that the major parallel circuits carry functionally different information. These functionally different parallel routes reach different portions of the hippocampal network along the longitudinal axis of all fields as well as along the perpendicularly oriented transverse axis of CA1 and the subiculum. In the remaining fields of the hippocampal formation, that is, the dentate gyrus and CA2/CA3, separation along the transverse axis is not present. By contrast, here the functionally different pathways converge onto the same neuronal population. The entorhinal cortex holds a pivotal position among the cortices that make up the parahippocampal region. By way of the networks of the superficial and deep layers, it mediates, respectively, the input and output streams of the hippocampal formation. Moreover, the intrinsic entorhinal network, particularly the interconnections between the deep and superficial layers, may mediate the comparison of hippocampal input and output signals. As such, the entorhinal cortex may form part of a novelty detection network. In addition, the organization of the entorhinal-hippocampal network may facilitate the holding of information. Finally, the terminal organization of the presubicular input to the medial entorhinal cortex indicates that the interactions between the deep and superficial entorhinal layers may be influenced by this input.},

A comparison of the patterns of retrograde cell-labeling charted in 26 such cases confirmed earlier findings in fiber-degeneration studies according to which the respective thalamocortical projections of the mediodorsal (MD) and anteromedial nucleus (AM) overlap each other over a wide region of the anterior medial cortex. This region of thalamocortical convergence, extending from pregenual levels caudalward as far as the anterior border of the retrosplenial cortex, corresponds almost exactly to the cortical region from which locally deposited HRP was found to be transported so as to label cells in one or both of two mesencephalic cell groups: the ventral tegmental area (AVT) dorsal and lateral to the interpeduncular nucleus, and the medial one-quarter of the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNC). The reported findings suggest that the corticipetal projections of A V T and SNC are organized so that A V T projects largely to the area infraradiata of the pregenual cortex which receives its major thalamocortical projection from MD, whereas SNC-efferents are distributed to the area infraradiata of the supracallosal cortex which receives most of its thalamocortical afferents from AM; the two mesencephalocortical projections do, however, appear to overlap each other in a region of the medial cortex immediately posterior to the level of the genu corporls callosi. HRP injected into the medial cortex of five rats pre-treated with 6-hydroxydopamine, a drug that produces chemical lesions of catecholamine neurons, failed to label any cells ii A V T and SNC but did label numerous cells in M D and A M . This finding suggest that the ventral tegmental cells projecting to the anterior medial cortex are ex clusively dopamine neurons.},

Studies in non-human species suggest that alteration in hippocampal and other neural circuitry may underlie behavioral deficits associated with aging but little is known about the neural mechanisms of human age-related decline in spatial navigation. The purpose of the present study was to examine age differences in functional brain activation during virtual environment navigation. Voxel-based analysis of activation patterns in young subjects identified activation in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, retrosplenial cortex, right and left lateral parietal cortex, medial parietal lobe and cerebellum. In comparison to younger subjects, elderly participants showed reduced activation in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, medial parietal lobe and retrosplenial cortex. Relative to younger participants elderly subjects showed increased activation in anterior cingulate gyrus and medial frontal lobe. These results provide evidence of age specific neural networks supporting spatial navigation and identify a putative neural substrate for age-related differences in spatial memory and navigational skill.},

They are able to track head direction using only internally-derived information (path integration) In this simulation study we investigate the factors that affect path integration accuracy. Speciﬁcally, two major limiting factors are identiﬁed: rise time, the time after stimulation it takes for a neuron to start ﬁring, and the presence of symmetric non-offset within-layer recurrent collateral connectivity. On the basis of the latter, the important prediction is made that head direction cell regions directly involved in path integration will not contain this type of connectivity; giving a theoretical explanation for architectural observations. Increased neuronal rise time is found to slow path integration, and the slowing effect for a given rise time is found to be more severe in the context of short conduction delays. Further work is suggested on the basis of our ﬁndings, which represent a valuable contribution to understanding of the head direction cell system.},

	abstract = {Methods: To identify early cognitive signs of AD conversion, some studies focused on amnestic-Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) by reporting alterations in both reference frames, especially the allocentric ones. However, spatial environments in which we move need the cooperation of both reference frames. Such cooperating processes imply that we constantly switch from allocentric to egocentric frames and vice versa. This raises the question of whether alterations of switching abilities might also characterize an early cognitive marker of AD, potentially suitable to detect the conversion from aMCI to dementia. Here, we compared AD and aMCI patients with Normal Controls (NC) on the Ego-AlloSwitching spatial memory task. The task assessed the capacity to use switching (Ego-Allo, Allo-Ego) and non-switching (Ego-Ego, Allo-Allo) verbal judgments about relative distances between memorized stimuli.
Results: The novel finding of this study is the neat impairment shown by aMCI and AD in switching from allocentric to egocentric reference frames. Interestingly, in aMCI when the first reference frame was egocentric, the allocentric deficit appeared attenuated.
Conclusion: This led us to conclude that allocentric deficits are not always clinically detectable in aMCI since the impairments could be masked when the first reference frame was body-centred. Alongside, AD and aMCI also revealed allocentric deficits in the non-switching condition. These findings suggest that switching alterations would emerge from impairments in hippocampal and posteromedial areas and from concurrent dysregulations in the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system or pre-frontal cortex.},

Intraneuronal neurofibrillary changes were encountered in the form of distended argyrophilic processes covering the medial convexity of the antero-ventral nucleus. Similar structures, although in considerably lesser density, occurred in the laterally adjoining reticular nucleus. The anterior nuclear complex, the latero-dorsal nucleus, portions of the intralaminar complex, the paraventricular and reuniens nucleus contained numerous neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. The antero-dorsal nucleus showed the most severe involvement. At first glance, the thalamus appeared to be only mildly affected by Alzheimer's disease. Closer inspection revealed that severe changes were confined to only a few limbic nuclei. These changes were virtually identical in amount, type and location in all cases of severe Alzheimer's disease studied. It is assumed that these changes considerably hamper the transport of information through limbic circuits.},

Epidemiological, neuropathological, and functional neuroimaging evidence implicates global and regional disruptions in brain metabolism and energetics in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Nerve cell microcircuits are modified by excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity and neurotrophic factors. Ageing and Alzheimer's disease cause perturbations in cellular energy metabolism, level of excitation or inhibition, and neurotrophic factor release, which overwhelm compensatory mechanisms and result in dysfunction of neuronal microcircuits and brain networks. A prolonged positive energy balance impairs the ability of neurons to adapt to oxidative and metabolic stress. Results from experimental studies in animals show how disruptions caused by chronic positive energy balance, such as diabetes, lead to accelerated cognitive ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic interventions to allay cognitive dysfunction that target energy metabolism and adaptive stress responses (such as neurotrophin signalling) have been effective in animal models and in preliminary studies in humans.},

We find that APP mice require considerably more training than controls to reach the same level of performance in a water maze task, and recall the trained location less well 24 hours later. At a single cell level, place fields from control mice become more stable and spatially restricted with repeated exposure to a new environment, while those in APP mice improve less over time, ultimately producing a spatial code of lower resolution, accuracy, and reliability than controls. The limited refinement of place fields in APP mice likely contributes to their delayed water maze acquisition, and provides evidence for circuit dysfunction underlying cognitive impairment.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the present experiment was to examine how distal cues and proximal objects interact to control ﬁring ﬁelds. In a previous study, Shapiro et al. (1997) Hippocampus 7:624–642, suggested that hippocampal place cell ﬁring is controlled by distal cues and proximal ﬂoor inserts in a ﬂexible and hierarchical fashion. Control exerted by the combined set of cues prevailed over control by distal cues, which itself prevailed over control by proximal cues. Here, we examined the generality of this hierarchy in the use of cues. Place cells were recorded as rats performed a pellet chasing task on a platform containing three proximal objects, surrounded by a curtain where three visual stimuli were hung. A double rotation of distal and proximal cue sets producing a 1808 mismatch revealed noncoherent responses of place cells. Most ﬁelds were controlled by the conﬁguration of proximal and distal cues (i.e., remapped). Less often, ﬁelds were controlled by speciﬁc cues with a majority being controlled by proximal cues, thus suggesting that response hierarchy is modulated by the environment. We ﬁnally examined the effect of removing one set of cues after the double rotation session. Half of the ﬁelds were controlled by the remaining cues while the other half remapped, thus suggesting a competition between pattern completion and pattern separation processes. Furthermore, cells that were controlled by the remaining cues were mainly those that had remapped in the double rotation session. Our results are compatible with the idea that the ﬂexibility of the place cell system results from an interaction between the sensory properties of individual cell and the attractor networks properties of the whole place cell population.

	abstract = {Classic computational theories of the mnemonic functions of the hippocampus ascribe the processes of pattern separation to the dentate gyrus (DG) and pattern completion to the CA3 region. Until the last decade, the large majority of single-unit studies of the hippocampus in behaving animals were from the CA1 region. The lack of data from the DG, CA3, and the entorhinal inputs to the hippocampus severely hampered the ability to test these theories with neurophysiological techniques. The past ten years have seen a major increase in the recordings from the CA3 region and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), with an increasing (but still limited) number of experiments from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and DG. This paper reviews a series of studies in a local-global cue mismatch (double-rotation) experiment in which recordings were made from cells in the anterior thalamus, MEC, LEC, DG, CA3, and CA1 regions. Compared to the standard cue environment, the change in the DG representation of the cue-mismatch environment was greater than the changes in its entorhinal inputs, providing support for the theory of pattern separation in the DG. In contrast, the change in the CA3 representation of the cue-mismatch environment was less than the changes in its entorhinal and DG inputs, providing support for a pattern completion/error correction function of CA3. The results are interpreted in terms of continuous attractor network models of the hippocampus and the relationship of these models to pattern separation and pattern completion theories. Whereas DG may perform an automatic pattern separation function, the attractor dynamics of CA3 allow it to perform a pattern separation or pattern completion function, depending on the nature of its inputs and the relative strength of the internal attractor dynamics.},

	abstract = {Background: High-ﬁeld MRI is a popular technique for the study of rodent brains. These datasets, while similar to human brain MRI in many aspects, present unique image processing challenges. We address a very common preprocessing step, skull-stripping, which refers to the segmentation of the brain tissue from the image for further processing. While several methods exist for addressing this problem, they are computationally expensive and often require interactive post-processing by an expert to clean up poorly segmented areas. This further increases total processing time per subject. New method: We propose a novel algorithm, based on grayscale mathematical morphology and LOGISMOS-based graph segmentation, which is rapid, robust and highly accurate.
Results: Comparative results obtained on two challenging in vivo datasets, consisting of 22 T1-weighted rat brain images and 10 T2-weighted mouse brain images illustrate the robustness and excellent performance of the proposed algorithm, in a fraction of the computational time needed by existing algorithms.
Comparison with existing methods: In comparison to current state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieved average Dice similarity coefﬁcient of 0.92 ± 0.02 and average Hausdorff distance of 13.6 ± 5.2 voxels (vs. 0.85 ± 0.20, p {\textless} 0.05 and 42.6 ± 22.9, p 0.001) for the rat dataset, and 0.96 ± 0.01 and average Hausdorff distance of 21.6 ± 12.7 voxels (vs. 0.93 ± 0.01, p 0.001 and 33.7 ± 3.5, p 0.001) for the mouse dataset. The proposed algorithm took approximately 90 s per subject, compared to 10–20 min for the neural-network based method and 30–90 min for the atlas-based method.
Conclusions: RATS is a robust and computationally efﬁcient method for accurate rodent brain skullstripping even in challenging data.},

We examined navigation strategy preference, its association with allocentric navigation, and the role of hippocampal and BF volumes in this association in early clinical stages of AD. Sixty nine participants—amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) due to AD (n = 28), AD dementia (n = 21), and cognitively normal (CN) older adults (n = 20)—underwent virtual Y-maze strategy assessment, real-space navigation testing, cognitive assessment, and hippocampal and BF volumetry. Preference for egocentric over allocentric strategy increased with AD severity (aMCI: 67\% vs. 33\%; dementia: 94\% vs. 6\%), which contrasted with preference in the CN group (39\% vs. 61\%). Those with aMCI who preferred egocentric strategy had worse allocentric navigation. Among those with aMCI, hippocampal and BF atrophy explained up to 25\% of the association between strategy preference and allocentric navigation. The preference for egocentric strategy in AD may reflect recruitment of compensatory extrahippocampal navigation strategies as adaptation to hippocampal and BF neurodegeneration.},

Verbalizations of all subjects were recorded, transcribed, and content-analyzedin order to identify the decisions made during the trip and to establish their functional relationships revealing their planning abilities. Results showed that all DAT patients failed to reach the destination and return to the point of departure without errors. Compared to normal elderly subjects, their overall decision plans were poorly structured, indicating basic problem-solving disorders. However, they were able to solve well-defined problems and develop sub-plans in routine situations when the necessary information was readily available. Nondiscriminatoryreading of irrelevant information was also observed and tended to interfere with problem-solving.},

This is commonly attributed to memory impairment, but it may reflect impaired spatial cognition. Methods: The authors examined the role of memory, perceptual, and cognitive mechanisms in spatial disorientation by comparing the performance of normal young (YN), middle-aged (MA), older adult (OA), and AD subjects on neuropsychological and spatial orientation tests. Results: The tendency to become lost is shared by almost all patients with AD (93\%) and some OA subjects (38\%). This impairment is not related to memory impairment. Instead, it reflects an inability to link recognized scenes with locations in the environment. Conclusions: Spatial disorientation reflects the impaired linking of landmarks and routes that should be assessed in conjunction with routine memory testing in elderly patients.},

Recent research has examined the potential importance of soluble species of Abeta in synaptic dysfunction, long before fibrillary Abeta is deposited and neurodegenerative changes occur. Hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity are disrupted in transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein with early onset familial AD mutations, and in rats after exogenous application of synthetic Abeta both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, naturally produced soluble Abeta was shown to block the persistence of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the intact hippocampus. Sub-nanomolar concentrations of oligomeric Abeta were sufficient to inhibit late LTP, pointing to a possible reason for the sensitivity of hippocampus-dependent memory to impairment in the early preclinical stages of AD. Having identified the active species of Abeta that can play havoc with synaptic plasticity, it is hoped that new ways of targeting early AD can be developed.},

	abstract = {Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is critically involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, but its physiological functions remain elusive. Importantly, APP knockout (APP-KO) mice exhibit cognitive deficits, suggesting that APP plays a role at the neuronal network level. To investigate this possibility, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the posterior parietal cortex, dorsal hippocampus and lateral prefrontal cortex of freely moving APP-KO mice. Spectral analyses showed that network oscillations within the theta- and gamma-frequency bands were not different between APP-KO and wild-type mice. Surprisingly, however, while gamma amplitude coupled to theta phase in all recorded regions of wild-type animals, in APP-KO mice theta-gamma coupling was strongly diminished in recordings from the parietal cortex and hippocampus, but not in LFPs recorded from the prefrontal cortex. Thus, lack of APP reduces oscillatory coupling in LFP recordings from specific brain regions, despite not affecting the amplitude of the oscillations. Together, our findings reveal reduced cross-frequency coupling as a functional marker of APP deficiency at the network level.},

Vestibular sensory input plays a critical role in spatial cognitive abilities such as spatial memory and spatial navigation. Vestibular function declines with age, and recent studies have shown that age-related vestibular impairment is associated with poorer spatial cognitive skills in healthy older adults. Moreover, vestibular impairment is disproportionately prevalent among individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, and specifically in cognitively-impaired individuals who have spatial deficits such as disorientation and difficulty driving. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that age-related vestibular impairment contributes to a ‘spatial’ subtype of Alzheimer’s disease, characterized by highly morbid symptoms such as wandering and falls. Given that vestibular impairment can be treated through simple, physical-therapy based exercises, identifying and treating vestibular deficits in older adults with and without cognitive impairment may offer substantial benefit in preventing, mitigating and forestalling cognitive decline.},

Specifically, patients show impairment in translating from an allocentric hippocampal representation to an egocentric parietal one for the purpose of effective spatial orientation and navigation. We suggest that a break in “mental frame syncing”, underpinned by damage to the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex, may be a crucial cognitive marker both for early and differential diagnosis of AD. Identification of these spatial deficits could facilitate the development of early cognitive rehabilitation interventions and the possibility of identifying individuals most at risk for progression to AD during the preclinical stages.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To estimate incidence, identify consequences and potential risk factors for harm in people with dementia who got lost in one UK policing region.Methods: In a retrospective observational study, data were extracted from missing-person records over a four-year period in one UK policing region (population of 2.1 million).Results: Two hundred and eighty-one incidents of getting lost were identified. Incidence of getting lost was estimated at 0.5\% of the regional dementia population. Fifty-nine percent of reports came from domestic settings, 29\% from care homes/hospitals, and 12\% on excursions from home. Five percent (n = 15) sustained significant harm, including two deaths. Average age was 78 years (SD 8.3). Harm was associated with older age (mean difference 6.16 years, CI 1.86 to 10.46, p = 0.005, t = 2.82), length of time missing (Mdn time 2.48 hours; IQR 0.97 to 9.45, p = 0.02), and season (9\% winter, 2\% summer, p = 0.006). The length of time missing increased with delays in reporting to police (r = 0.15, p = 0.018), getting lost at night (Mdn time 1.70 hours, IQR 0.52–3.32, p = 0.028), driving themselves (Mdn time 2.45 hours, IQR 0.42–2.00, p = 0.001), and using public transport (Mdn 1.78 hours, IQR 1.07–3.92, p = 0.001).Conclusion: Incidence in this study suggests getting lost is a low-frequency event for people with dementia but for a small minority, the risks are considerable. Exploratory analyses suggest individual and environmental factors increase the risk of harm. Suitable methods need to be developed to replicate these findings in larger prospective samples. A focus on the predictors of harm may aid development of assessment protocols to ensure intervention is proportionate.},

This study compared overhead and first-person view perspective taking abilities in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. A newly developed Arena Perspective Taking Task (APTT), using an environment of a circular arena, was used to compare 23 AD patients and 38 amnestic MCI patients with 18 healthy controls. The results were contrasted with a published perspective taking test (Standardized Road-Map Test of Direction Sense, RMTDS). The AD group was impaired in both overhead and first-person view APTT versions, but the impairment in the overhead view version applied specifically to women. Patients with aMCI were impaired in the first-person view but not in the overhead view version. Substantial sexual differences were found in the overhead but not in the first-person view APTT version. The RMTDS resembled both APTT versions: patients with aMCI were impaired in this test and also women in both patient groups were less accurate than men. Using the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the highest predictive power for MCI and AD patients diagnosis versus controls was observed for their success rate in the first-person view version. The results suggest distinction between overhead and first-person view perspective taking in the impairment of aMCI patients and the sex differences. The first-person view perspective taking is a potentially important candidate psychological marker for AD.},

	abstract = {The current theories on episodic memory suggest a crucial role of spatial processing for an effective retrieval. When prompted by a retrieval cue, the full past scene can be retrieved through the process of pattern completion. Thanks to retrosplenial cortex, this allocentric representation is translated to an egocentric representation in the medial parietal areas via information updating from other cells: place cells inform the viewpoint location, head-direction cells the viewing direction, and grid cells the self-motion signals. Based on several evidence, we argue that a crucial role for an episodic retrieval is played by a \&quot;mental frame syncing\&quot; between the allocentric view-point dependent representation and the allocentric view-point independent representation. If the mental frame syncing stops, even momentarily, it is difficult to reconstruct a coherent representation for an effective episodic recall. This is what apparently happens in Alzheimer\&\#39;s disease: a break in the “mental frame syncing” between these two kinds of allocentric representations, underpinned by damage to the hippocampus, may contribute significantly to the early deficit in episodic memory.},

	abstract = {Detection of incipient Alzheimer disease (AD) pathophysiology is critical to identify preclinical individuals and target potentially disease-m odifying therapies towards them. Current neuroimaging and biomarker research is strongly focused in this direction, with the aim of establishing AD fingerprints to identify individuals at high risk of developing this disease. By contrast, cognitive fingerprints for incipient AD are virtually non-e xistent as diagnostics and outcomes measures are still focused on episodic memory deficits as the gold standard for AD, despite their low sensitivity and specificity for identifying at-r isk individuals. This Review highlights a novel feature of cognitive evaluation for incipient AD by focusing on spatial navigation and orientation deficits, which are increasingly shown to be present in at-r isk individuals. Importantly , the navigation system in the brain overlaps substantially with the regions affected by AD in both animal models and humans. Notably , spatial navigation has fewer verbal, cultural and educational biases than current cognitive tests and could enable a more uniform, global approach towards cognitive fingerprints of AD and better cognitive treatment outcome measures in future multicentre trials. The current Review appraises the available evidence for spatial navigation and/or orientation deficits in preclinical, prodromal and confirmed AD and identifies research gaps and future research priorities.},

To consider the phenomenon of wandering behaviour in demented patients, we conducted searches using Medline and Google Scholar to ﬁnd relevant articles, chapters, and books published since 1975. Search terms used included ‘wandering’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘dementia’, ‘nursing’, and ‘elopements’. Publications found through this indexed search were reviewed for further relevant references. The term ‘wandering’ covers different types of behaviour, including aimless movement without a discernible purpose. It is associated with a variety of negatives outcomes. The aetiology of wandering is poorly understood and it remains an unsolved riddle. Wandering is an acutely distressing problem worldwide, both for the patients and caregivers, and it is a major reason for nursing home admission. Evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions is limited. It is possible that management of coexistent psychopathology would help to ameliorate this problematic behavioural disorder.},

	abstract = {Background: Patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and many older adults become lost even in familiar surroundings. This is commonly attributed to memory impairment, but it may reflect impaired spatial cognition. Methods: The authors examined the role of memory, perceptual, and cognitive mechanisms in spatial disorientation by comparing the performance of normal young (YN), middle-aged (MA), older adult (OA), and AD subjects on neuropsychological and spatial orientation tests. Results: The tendency to become lost is shared by almost all patients with AD (93\%) and some OA subjects (38\%). This impairment is not related to memory impairment. Instead, it reflects an inability to link recognized scenes with locations in the environment. Conclusions: Spatial disorientation reflects the impaired linking of landmarks and routes that should be assessed in conjunction with routine memory testing in elderly patients.},

Head direction cells were found in the presubiculum. The ﬁring rate of these cells was a function of the head direction of the monkey, with a response that was typically 10–100 times larger to the best as compared to the opposite direction. The mean half-amplitude width of the tuning of the cells was 76°. The response of head direction cells in the presubiculum was not inﬂuenced by the place where the monkey was, there being the same tuning to head direction at different places in a room, and even outside the room. The response of these cells was also independent of the ‘‘spatial view’’ observed by the monkey, and also the position of the eyes in the head. The average information about head direction was 0.64 bits, about place was 0.10 bits, about spatial view was 0.27 bits, and about eye position was 0.04 bits. The cells maintained their tuning for periods of at least several minutes when the view details were obscured or the room was darkened. This representation of head direction could be useful together with the hippocampal spatial view cells and whole body motion cells found in primates in such spatial and memory functions as path integration.

In concert with other spatial cells in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) [3–6], they provide a representation of our location within an environment [7, 8] and are speciﬁcally thought to allow the represented location to be updated by self-motion [9]. Grid-like signals have been seen throughout the autobiographical memory system [10], suggesting a much more general role in memory [11, 12]. Grid cells may allow us to move our viewpoint in imagination [13], a useful function for goaldirected navigation and planning [12, 14–16], and episodic future thinking more generally [17, 18]. We used fMRI to provide evidence for similar grid-like signals in human entorhinal cortex during both virtual navigation and imagined navigation of the same paths. We show that this signal is present in periods of active navigation and imagination, with a similar orientation in both and with the speciﬁcally 6-fold rotational symmetry characteristic of grid cell ﬁring. We therefore provide the ﬁrst evidence suggesting that grid cells are utilized during movement of viewpoint within imagery, potentially underpinning our more general ability to mentally traverse possible routes in the service of planning and episodic future thinking.},

Theoretical studies, in conjunction with recent empirical discoveries, suggest that the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) might perform some of the essential underlying computations by means of a unique, periodic synaptic matrix that could be self-organized in early development through a simple, symmetry-breaking operation. The scale at which space is represented increases systematically along the dorsoventral axis in both the hippocampus and the MEC, apparently because of systematic variation in the gain of a movement-speed signal. Convergence of spatially periodic input at multiple scales, from so-called grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, might result in non-periodic spatial firing patterns (place fields) in the hippocampus.},

Self-report measures of environmental abilities, e.g., asking people to rate their ‘‘sense of direction (SOD),’’ have been found to predict objective measures of these abilities quite highly. In this study, we developed a standardized self-report scale of environmental spatial ability, the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale (SBSOD). The scale proved to be internally consistent and had good test –retest reliability. A series of four validity studies examined its relation to measures of spatial updating and acquisition of spatial knowledge at different scales and acquired from different learning experiences. These studies suggested that the SBSOD is related to tasks that require one to update location in space as a result of self-motion. It is more highly correlated with tests of spatial knowledge that involve orienting oneself within the environment than with tests that involve estimating distances or drawing maps. Self-report SOD is also somewhat more highly correlated with measures of spatial knowledge acquired from direct experience in the environment than with measures of knowledge acquired from maps, video, or virtual environments (VE).},

	abstract = {Summary
Temporally precise neuronal firing phase-locked to gamma oscillations is thought to mediate the dynamic interaction of neuronal populations, which is essential for information processing underlying higher-order functions such as learning and memory. However, the cellular mechanisms determining phase locking remain unclear. By devising a virus-mediated approach to perform multi-tetrode recording from genetically manipulated neurons, we demonstrated that synaptic plasticity dependent on the GluR1 subunit of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptor mediates two dynamic changes in neuronal firing in the hippocampal CA1 area during novel experiences: the establishment of phase-locked firing to slow gamma oscillations and the rapid formation of the spatial firing pattern of place cells. The results suggest a series of events potentially underlying the acquisition of new spatial information: slow gamma oscillations, originating from the CA3 area, induce the two GluR1-dependent changes of CA1 neuronal firing, which in turn determine information flow in the hippocampal-entorhinal system.},

As the animal traverses a spatial trajectory, individual locations along the trajectory activate these neurons in a unique firing sequence, which yields a memory code representing the trajectory. How this type of memory code is altered in dementia-producing neurodegenerative disorders is unknown. Here we show that in transgenic rTg4510 mice, a model of tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease, hippocampal neurons did not fire at specific locations, yet displayed robust firing sequences as animals run along familiar or novel trajectories. The sequences seen on the trajectories also appeared during free exploration of open spaces. The spatially dissociated firing sequences suggest that hippocampal neurons in the transgenic mice are not primarily driven by external space but by internally generated brain activities. We propose that tau pathology and/or neurodegeneration renders hippocampal circuits overwhelmed by internal information and therefore prevents them from encoding spatial memories.},

They fire at specific locations in a space (place fields) and fire in precise patterns during theta sequences and during ripple-associated replay events. These phenomena have been extensively studied in rats, but to a less extent in mice. The availability of versatile genetic manipulations gives mice an advantage for place cell studies. However, it is unknown how place fields and place cell sequences in the same environment differ between mice and rats. Here, we provide a quantitative comparison in place field properties, as well as theta sequences and replays, between rats and mice as they ran on the same novel track and as they rested afterwards. We found that place cells in mice display less spatial specificity with more but smaller place fields. Theta oscillations, theta phase precession and aspects of theta sequences in mice are similar as those in rats. The ripple-associated replay, however, is relatively rare during stopping on the novel track in mice. The replay is present during resting after the track running, but is weaker in mice than the replay in rats. Our results suggest that place cells in mice and rats are qualitatively similar, but with substantial quantitative differences.},

To study the interaction between Abeta and tau and their effect on synaptic function, we derived a triple-transgenic model (3xTg-AD) harboring PS1(M146V), APP(Swe), and tau(P301L) transgenes. Rather than crossing independent lines, we microinjected two transgenes into single-cell embryos from homozygous PS1(M146V) knockin mice, generating mice with the same genetic background. 3xTg-AD mice progressively develop plaques and tangles. Synaptic dysfunction, including LTP deficits, manifests in an age-related manner, but before plaque and tangle pathology. Deficits in long-term synaptic plasticity correlate with the accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta. These studies suggest a novel pathogenic role for intraneuronal Abeta with regards to synaptic plasticity. The recapitulation of salient features of AD in these mice clarifies the relationships between Abeta, synaptic dysfunction, and tangles and provides a valuable model for evaluating potential AD therapeutics as the impact on both lesions can be assessed.},

A new rat model (TgF344-AD) of AD overcomes many limitations of other rodent models, though spatial navigation has not been comprehensively assessed. Using the hidden and cued platform variants of the Morris water task, a longitudinal assessment of spatial navigation was conducted on TgF344-AD (n = 16) and Fischer 344 (n = 12) male and female rats at three age ranges: 4 to 5 months, 7 to 8, and 10 to 11 months of age. TgF344-AD rats exhibited largely intact navigation at 4–5 months, with deficits in the hidden platform task emerging at 7–8 months and becoming significantly pronounced at 10–11 months of age. In general, TgF344-AD rats displayed less accurate swim trajectories to the platform and searched a wider area around the platform region compared to wildtype rats. Impaired navigation occurred in the absence of deficits in acquiring the procedural task demands or navigation to the cued platform location. Together, the results indicate that TgF344-AD rats exhibit comparable navigational deficits to those found in individuals with preclinical-AD.},

We begin with a brief overview of the neuropathological changes seen in the AD brain and an outline of some of the clinical neuropsychological assessments used to measure cognitive deficits associated with the disease. This is followed by a critical assessment of behavioral tasks that are used in AD mice to model the cognitive changes seen in the human disease. Behavioral tests discussed include spatial memory tests [Morris water maze (MWM), radial arm water maze (RAWM), Barnes maze], associative learning tasks (passive avoidance, fear conditioning), alternation tasks (Y-Maze/T-Maze), recognition memory tasks (Novel Object Recognition), attentional tasks (3 and 5 choice serial reaction time), set-shifting tasks, and reversal learning tasks. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of these behavioral tasks, and how they may correlate with clinical assessments in humans. Finally, the temporal progression of both cognitive and non-cognitive deficits in 10 AD mouse models (PDAPP, TG2576, APP23, TgCRND8, J20, APP/PS1, TG2576 + PS1 (M146L), APP/PS1 KI, 5×FAD, and 3×Tg-AD) are discussed in detail. Mouse models of AD and the behavioral tasks used in conjunction with those models are immensely important in contributing to our knowledge of disease progression and are a useful tool to study AD pathophysiology and the resulting cognitive deficits. However, investigators need to be aware of the potential weaknesses of the available preclinical models in terms of their ability to model cognitive changes observed in human AD. It is our hope that this review will assist investigators in selecting an appropriate mouse model, and accompanying behavioral paradigms to investigate different aspects of AD pathology and disease progression.},

Proportionally, the likelihood of detecting significant impairment in Tg2576 mice (relative to age-matched controls) was found to be: highest with the use of T-maze alternation and the radial arm water maze; intermediate when using the Morris water maze and continuous Y-maze alternation; and lowest when using the circular platform maze. These results are indicative rather than conclusive, but have implications for testing cognitive function in Tg2576 mice and, potentially, other AD rodent models. The apparent sensitivity of the T-maze alternation task and reduced sensitivity of the Morris water maze task (reference memory version) are discussed.

	abstract = {Normal aging and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with declines in navigational skills, including allocentric and egocentric representations, cognitive mapping, landmark processing, and spatial memory. These changes, however, are associated with different patterns of structural and functional alterations in the neural network of navigation. In AD, these changes occur in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, parietal lobe, retrosplenial cortex, prefrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus, whereas in aging, modifications occur mainly in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. The navigation abilities of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been found to show different performance patterns, depending on their cognitive profiles. Since patients with MCI do not uniformly develop dementia of the Alzheimer type, it is important to identify reliable early cognitive markers of conversion to AD dementia. In this review, we propose that navigation deficits may help distinguish patients at higher risk of developing AD dementia from individuals with normal cognitive aging and those with other neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Three experiments with 77 undergraduates studied sense of direction as a verbal expression of people's estimation of their own spatial orientation ability, rather than as a special mental faculty. Self-reports of sense of direction were shown to reflect spatial orientation ability. Ss with good senses of direction were better than ones with poor senses of direction at pointing to unseen goals (local buildings) in a familiar environment. In a novel environment (a maze) after minimal experience during which the need for orientation was not emphasized, good and poor sense-of-direction Ss did not differ in the accuracy of their mental representation of the area. Given additional exposure in which orientation was emphasized, good sense-of-direction Ss showed improved accuracy of their representation of the area, whereas poor sense-of-direction Ss showed no hint of improved performance. It is concluded, then, that the improved orientation of people with a good sense of direction is not automatic or facile, but requires possibly both (a) a conscious effort to orient and (b) repeated exposure to an environment.

Regardless of a person's spatial cognitive style (i.e., landmark, route, or survey), the greater their familiarity with the environment, the better their performance. In this study, a questionnaire was used, the Familiarity and Spatial Cognitive Style Scale, to measure 208 women's sense of direction and knowledge of their city of residence. Analysis showed that Spatial Cognitive Style predicted sense of direction but not town knowledge.

Sixty nine participants—amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) due to AD (n = 28), AD dementia (n = 21), and cognitively normal (CN) older adults (n = 20)—underwent virtual Y-maze strategy assessment, real-space navigation testing, cognitive assessment, and hippocampal and BF volumetry. Preference for egocentric over allocentric strategy increased with AD severity (aMCI: 67\% vs. 33\%; dementia: 94\% vs. 6\%), which contrasted with preference in the CN group (39\% vs. 61\%). Those with aMCI who preferred egocentric strategy had worse allocentric navigation. Among those with aMCI, hippocampal and BF atrophy explained up to 25\% of the association between strategy preference and allocentric navigation. The preference for egocentric strategy in AD may reflect recruitment of compensatory extrahippocampal navigation strategies as adaptation to hippocampal and BF neurodegeneration.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology begins decades prior to onset of clinical symptoms, and the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus are among the first and most extensively impacted brain regions. The TgF344-AD rat model, which more fully recapitulates human AD pathology in an age-dependent manner, is a next generation preclinical rodent model for understanding pathophysiological processes underlying the earliest stages of AD (Cohen et al., 2013). Whether synaptic alterations occur in hippocampus prior to reported learning and memory deficit is not known. Furthermore, it is not known if specific hippocampal synapses are differentially affected by progressing AD pathology, or if synaptic deficits begin to appear at the same age in males and females in this preclinical model. Here, we investigated the time-course of synaptic changes in basal transmission, paired-pulse ratio, as an indirect measure of presynaptic release probability, long-term potentiation (LTP), and dendritic spine density at two hippocampal synapses in male and ovariectomized female TgF344-AD rats and wildtype littermates, prior to reported behavioral deficits. Decreased basal synaptic transmission begins at medial perforant path-dentate granule cell (MPP-DGC) synapses prior to Schaffer-collateral-CA1 (CA3-CA1) synapses, in the absence of a change in paired-pulse ratio (PPR) or dendritic spine density. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent LTP magnitude is unaffected at CA3-CA1 synapses at 6, 9, and 12months of age, but is significantly increased at MPP-DGC synapses in TgF344-AD rats at 6months only. Sex differences were only observed at CA3-CA1 synapses where the decrease in basal transmission occurs at a younger age in males versus females. These are the first studies to define presymptomatic alterations in hippocampal synaptic transmission in the TgF344-AD rat model. The time course of altered synaptic transmission mimics the spread of pathology through hippocampus in human AD and provides support for this model as a valuable preclinical tool in elucidating pathological mechanisms of early synapse dysfunction in AD.},

The movements include home base behavior, which serves as a central point of attraction from which rats and mice organize exploratory trips into the remaining environment. In this review, we describe some of the features of this organized behavior pattern as well as its modulation by sensory cues and previous experience. We conclude the review by summarizing research investigating the neurobiological bases of exploration, which we hope will stimulate renewed interest and research on the neural systems mediating these behaviors.},

This introductory level protocol describes the reagents, equipment, and techniques required to complete immunohistochemical staining of rodent brain tissue, using markers for microglia and neuronal elements as an example. Specifically, this paper is a step-by-step protocol for fluorescent visualization of microglia and neurons via immunohistochemistry for Iba1 and Pan-neuronal, respectively. Fluorescence double-labeling is particularly useful for the localization of multiple proteins within the same sample, providing the opportunity to accurately observe interactions between cell types, receptors, ligands, and/or the extracellular matrix in relation to one another as well as protein co-localization within a single cell. Unlike other visualization techniques, fluorescence immunohistochemistry staining intensity may decrease in the weeks to months following staining, unless appropriate precautions are taken. Despite this limitation, in many applications fluorescence double-labeling is preferred over alternatives such as 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) or alkaline phosphatase (AP), as fluorescence is more time efficient and allows for more precise differentiation between two or more markers.

	abstract = {Background: Ethanol consumption during pregnancy can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which consists of the complete spectrum of developmental deﬁcits including neurological dysfunction. FASD is associated with a variety of neurobehavioral disturbances dependent on the age and duration of exposure. Ethanol exposure in neonatal rodents can also induce widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration and long-lasting behavioral abnormalities similar to FASD. The developmental stage of neonatal rodent brains that are at the peak of synaptogenesis is equivalent to the third trimester of human gestation.
Methods: Male and female C57BL ⁄ 6By mice were injected with ethanol (20\%, 2.5 g ⁄ kg, 2 s.c. injections) or an equal volume of saline (controls) on postnatal day 7 (P7). Animals were allowed to mature and at 3 months were tested on an olfactory habituation task known to be dependent on piriform cortex function, a hippocampal-dependent object place memory task, and used for electrophysiological testing of spontaneous and odor-evoked local ﬁeld potential (LFP) activity in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, and dorsal hippocampus.
Results: P7 ethanol induced widespread cell death within 1 day of exposure, with highest levels in the neocortex, intermediate levels in the dorsal hippocampus, and relatively low levels in the primary olfactory system. No impairment of odor investigation or odor habituation was detected in P7 ethanol-exposed 3-month-old mice compared to saline controls. However, hippocampaldependent object place memory was signiﬁcantly impaired in the P7 ethanol-treated adult mice. Odor-evoked LFP activity was enhanced throughout the olfacto-hippocampal pathway, primarily within the theta frequency band, although the hippocampus also showed elevated evoked delta frequency activity. In addition, functional coherence between the piriform cortex and olfactory bulb and between the piriform cortex and dorsal hippocampus was enhanced in the beta frequency range in P7 ethanol-treated adult mice compared to controls.
Conclusions: P7 ethanol induces an immediate wave of regionally selective cell death followed by long-lasting changes in local circuit and regional network function that are accompanied by changes in neurobehavioral performance. The results suggest that both the activity of local neural circuits within a brain region and the ﬂow of information between brain regions can be modiﬁed by early alcohol exposure, which may contribute to long-lasting behavioral abnormalities known to rely on those circuits.},

	abstract = {Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can lead to long-lasting neurological alterations that may predispose individuals to seizures and neurobehavioral dysfunction. To date, there exists limited information regarding the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The hippocampal CA3 region generates excitatory population activity, called sharp waves (SPWs), that provide an ideal model to study perturbations in neuronal excitability at the network and cellular levels. In the present study, we utilized a mouse model of PAE and used dual extracellular and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA3 hippocampal pyramidal cells to evaluate the effect of 1st trimester-equivalent ethanol exposure (10\% v/v) on SPW activity and excitatory/inhibitory balance. We observed that PAE significantly altered in vitro SPW waveforms, with an increased duration and amplitude, when compared to controls. In addition, PAE slices exhibited reduced pharmacological inhibition by the GABA-A receptor antagonist bicuculline (BMI) on SPW activity, and increased population spike paired-pulse ratios, all indicative of network disinhibition within the PAE hippocampus. Evaluation of PAE CA3 pyramidal cell activity associated with SPWs, revealed increased action potential cell firing, which was accompanied by an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory synaptic drive, shifted in favor of excitation. Moreover, we observed intrinsic changes in CA3 pyramidal activity in PAE animals, including increased burst firing and instantaneous firing rate. This is the first study to provide evidence for hippocampal dysfunction in the ability to maintain network homeostasis and underlying cellular hyperexcitability in a model of PAE. These circuit and cellular level alterations may contribute to the increased propensity for seizures and neurobehavioral dysfunction observed in patients with a history of PAE.},

Derived from progenitor cells located in the proliferative zones of the ventral telencephalon, newly generated GABAergic Interneuron migrate to their cortical destinations. Cortical dysfunction associated with defects in neuronal migration results in severe developmental consequences. There is growing evidence linking prenatal ethanol exposure to abnormal GABAergic interneuronal migration and subsequent cortical dysfunction. Investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms behind disrupted GABAergic interneuronal migration encountered with prenatal alcohol exposure is crucial for understanding and managing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. This review explores the molecular pathways regulating GABAergic interneuronal cortical migration that might be altered by prenatal ethanol exposure thus opening new avenues for further research in this topic.},

This study determined whether third-trimester equivalent alcohol exposure reduced the number of mPFC GABAergic parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, hypothesized to play an important role in local inhibition of the mPFC. The impact on passive avoidance learning and the therapeutic role of aerobic exercise in adulthood was also explored. Male C57BL/6J mice received either saline or 5g/kg ethanol (two doses, two hours apart) on PD 5, 7, and 9. On PD 35, animals received a running wheel or remained sedentary for 48days before behavioral testing and perfusion on PD 83. The number of PV+ interneurons was stereologically measured in three separate mPFC subregions: infralimbic, prelimbic and anterior cingulate cortices (ACC). Neonatal alcohol exposure decreased number of PV+ interneurons and volume of the ACC, but the other regions of the mPFC were spared. Alcohol impaired acquisition, but not retrieval of passive avoidance, and had no effect on motor performance on the rotarod. Exercise had no impact on PV+ cell number, mPFC volume, or acquisition of passive avoidance, but enhanced retrieval in both control and alcohol-exposed groups, and enhanced rotarod performance in the control mice. Results support the hypothesis that part of the behavioral deficits associated with developmental alcohol exposure are due to reduced PV+ interneurons in the ACC, but unfortunately exercise does not appear to be able to reverse any of these deficits.},

	abstract = {Synchronized neuronal activity occurring at different developmental stages in various brain structures represents a hallmark of developmental circuits. This activity, which differs in its specific patterns among animal species may play a crucial role in de novo formation and in shaping neuronal networks. In the rodent hippocampus in vitro, the so-called giant depolarizing potentials or GDPs constitute a primordial form of neuronal synchrony preceding more organized forms of activity such as oscillations in the theta and gamma frequency range. GDPs are generated at the network level by the interaction of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA which, immediately after birth, exert both a depolarizing and excitatory.action on their targets. GDPs are triggered by GABAergic interneurons, which in virtue of their extensive axonal branching operate as functional hubs to synchronize large ensembles of cells. Intrinsic bursting activity, driven by a persistent sodium conductance and facilitated by the low expression of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 channel subunits, responsible for IM , exerts a permissive role in GDP generation. Here, we discuss how GDPs are generated in a probabilistic way when neuronal excitability within a local circuit reaches a certain threshold and how GDP-associated calcium transients act as coincident detectors for enhancing synaptic strength at emerging GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. We discuss the possible in vivo correlate of this activity. Finally, we debate recent data showing how, in several animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, a GDPs dysfunction is associated to morphological alterations of neuronal circuits and behavioral deficits reminiscent of those observed in patients.},

	abstract = {Gestational exposure to alcohol can result in long-lasting behavioral deficiencies generally described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). FASD-modeled rodent studies of acute ethanol exposure typically select one developmental window to simulate a specific context equivalent of human embryogenesis, and study consequences of ethanol exposure within that particular developmental epoch. Exposure timing is likely a large determinant in the neurobehavioral consequence of early ethanol exposure, as each brain region is variably susceptible to ethanol cytotoxicity and has unique sensitive periods in their development. We made a parallel comparison of the long-term effects of single-day binge ethanol at either embryonic day 8 (E8) or postnatal day 7 (P7) in male and female mice, and here demonstrate the differential long-term impacts on neuroanatomy, behavior and in vivo electrophysiology of two systems with very different developmental trajectories. The significant long-term differences in odor-evoked activity, local circuit inhibition, and spontaneous coherence between brain regions in the olfacto-hippocampal pathway that were found as a result of developmental ethanol exposure, varied based on insult timing. Long-term effects on cell proliferation and interneuron cell density were also found to vary by insult timing as well as by region. Finally, spatial memory performance and object exploration were affected in P7-exposed mice, but not E8-exposed mice. Our physiology and behavioral results are conceptually coherent with the neuroanatomical data attained from these same mice. Our results recognize both variable and shared effects of ethanol exposure timing on long-term circuit function and their supported behavior.},

Activity in hippocampal slices from the ethanoltreated animals displayed several abnormalities including a threefold increase in overall neuronal firing and profound, by nearly sevenfold, reduction of synchronization of CA3 units in giant depolarizing potentials. Thus, alterations in the hippocampal network function emerge shortly after the ethanol exposure and manifest in the enhanced excitation and severe impairments to the giant depolarizing potentials.},

	abstract = {1. Intracellular recordings were made from rat CA3 hippocampal neurones in vitro during the first eighteen days of postnatal life. The cells had resting membrane potentials more negative than -51 mV, action potentials greater than 55 mV and membrane input resistances of 117 +/- 12 M omega. An unusual characteristic of these cells was the presence of spontaneous giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) which were observed during the first eight postnatal (P) days in over 85\% of neurones. They were less frequent between P9 and P12 (48\%) and disappeared after P12. 2. The GDPs were synchronously generated by a population of neurones; they reversed polarity at -27 mV when recorded with KCl-containing electrodes and at -51 mV with potassium acetate- or potassium methylsulphate-filled electrodes. 3. The GDPs were blocked by bath application of bicuculline (10 microM) or picrotoxin (100-200 microM). Exogenously applied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA; 0.2-1 mM) induced at resting membrane potential a bicuculline-sensitive membrane depolarization which reversed polarity at -25 and -51 mV when recorded with KCl- or potassium methylsulphate-filled electrodes respectively. 4. The GDPs were reduced in frequency or blocked by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists DL-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate (AP-7; 50 microM), D(-)2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (AP-5, 10-50 microM) and (+-)3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP, 10-50 microM) or NMDA channel blockers phencyclidine (2 microM) and ketamine (20 microM). 5. Stimulation of the hilus during the first week of life evoked a GDP followed by a hyperpolarization. The GDPs were generated by a population of synchronized neurones and reversed polarity at -27 mV with KCl-filled electrodes and at -52 mV with potassium acetate- or potassium methylsulphate-containing electrodes. 6. Bath application of bicuculline (1-10 microM) or picrotoxin (100-200 microM) reversibly blocked the evoked GDPs in the majority of cells. The NMDA receptor antagonists AP-5 (50 microM), AP-7 (50 microM) and CPP (30 microM) usually reduced the amplitude and the duration of the evoked GDPs. In neurones in which evoked GDPs were blocked by bicuculline, a NMDA-mediated component was revealed by increasing the strength or the frequency of stimulation. 7. During the second week of postnatal life, when spontaneous GDPs were extremely rare or absent, superfusion with bicuculline (10 microM) induced, as in adult slices, interictal discharges. These reversed polarity near 0 mV with KCl- or potassium acetate-containing electrodes and were reduced in amplitude and duration by AP-5 (50 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Sleep fragmentation, a symptom in many clinical disorders, leads to cognitive impairments. To investigate the mechanisms by which sleep fragmentation results in memory impairments, rats were awakened once every 2 min via 30 s of slow movement on an automated treadmill. Within 1 h of this sleep interruption (SI) schedule, rats began to sleep in the 90-s periods without treadmill movement. Total non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) sleep time did not change over the 24 h of SI, although there was a significant decline in rapid eye movement sleep (REM) sleep and a corresponding increase in time spent awake. In the SI group, the mean duration of sleep episodes decreased and delta activity during periods of wake increased. Control rats either lived in the treadmill without movement (cage controls, CC), or had 10 -min periods of movement followed by 30 min of non-movement allowing deep/continuous sleep (exercise controls, EC). EC did not differ from baseline in the total time spent in each vigilance state. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting change in synaptic efficacy thought to underlie declarative memory formation, was absent in rats exposed to 24 and 72 h SI. In contrast, LTP was normal in EC rats. However, long-term depression and paired-pulse facilitation were unaltered by 24 h SI. Twenty-four hour SI also impaired acquisition of spatial learning in the hippocampus-dependent water maze test. Twenty-four hour SI elevated plasma corticosterone (CORT) to levels previously shown to enhance LTP (125 ng/mL). The results suggest that sleep fragmentation negatively impacts spatial learning. Loss of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region may be one mechanism involved in this deficit.},

	abstract = {Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) results in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which is characterized by a wide range of cognitive and behavioral deﬁcits that may be linked to impaired hippocampal function and adult neurogenesis. Preclinical studies in mouse models of FASD indicate that PAE markedly attenuates enrichment-mediated increases in the number of adult-generated hippocampal dentate granule cells (aDGCs), but whether synaptic activity is also affected has not been studied. Here, we utilized retroviral birth-dating coupled with whole cell patch electrophysiological recordings to assess the effects of PAE on enrichmentmediated changes in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity as a function of DGC age. We found that exposure to an enriched environment (EE) had no effect on baseline synaptic activity of 4- or 8-week-old aDGCs from control mice, but signiﬁcantly enhanced the excitatory/inhibitory ratio of synaptic activity in 8-week-old aDGCs from PAE mice. In contrast, exposure to EE signiﬁcantly enhanced the excitatory/inhibitory ratio of synaptic activity in older pre-existing DGCs situated in the outer dentate granule cell layer (i.e., those generated during embryonic development; dDGCs) in control mice, an effect that was blunted in PAE mice. These ﬁndings indicate distinct electrophysiological responses of hippocampal DGCs to behavioral challenge based on cellular ontogenetic age, and suggest that PAE disrupts EE-mediated changes in overall hippocampal network activity. These ﬁndings may have implications for future therapeutic targeting of hippocampal dentate circuitry in clinical FASD. VC 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {In the first of two papers dealing with the distribution of glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP)-immunoreactive elements in the rat brain, the localization of immunostaining in the forebrain is systematically described. While the limbic cortex was found to contain intensely stained, evenly distributed astrocytes, the neocortex showed clearly stratified GFAP-staining, with substantially less immunoreactivity occurring in the middle layers than in the areas close to the brain surface or the white matter. A remarkably regular staining pattern was observed in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. The striatum remained unstained in sharp contrast to the pallidum. In the diencephalon, the main thalamic nuclei were poor in GFAP-labelled elements in contrast to the internuclear border zones. In the hypothalamus, nuclei were conspicuous by their GFAP-staining. A consistent differential staining pattern was obtained in the epithalamic structures. The observed distributional pattern of diencephalic GFAP-immunoreactivity is thought to be due to different regional proliferation of the embryonic neuroepithelium of the diencephalon. The uneven distribution of GFAPimmunoreactivity in the forebrain is explained on a mainly developmental basis.},

	abstract = {Developmental exposure to ethanol leads to a constellation of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs). Many cell types throughout the central nervous system are negatively impacted by gestational alcohol exposure, including inhibitory, GABAergic interneurons. Little evidence exists, however, describing the long-term impact of fetal alcohol exposure on survival of interneurons within the hippocampal formation, which is critical for learning and memory processes that are impaired in individuals with FASDs. Mice expressing Venus yellow fluorescent protein in inhibitory interneurons were exposed to vaporized ethanol during the third trimester equivalent of human gestation (postnatal days 2–9), and the long-term effects on interneuron numbers were measured using unbiased stereology at P90. In adulthood, interneuron populations were reduced in every hippocampal region examined. Moreover, we found that a single exposure to ethanol at P7 caused robust activation of apoptotic neurodegeneration of interneurons in the hilus, granule cell layer, CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. These studies demonstrate that developmental ethanol exposure has a long-term impact on hippocampal interneuron survivability, and may provide a mechanism partially explaining deficits in hippocampal function and hippocampus-dependent behaviors in those afflicted with FASDs.},

We find that in the hours following single-trial contextual fear conditioning (CFC), fast-spiking interneurons (which typically express parvalbumin (PV)) show greater firing coherence with CA1 network oscillations. Post-CFC inhibition of PV+ interneurons blocks fear memory consolidation. This effect is associated with loss of two network changes associated with normal consolidation: (1) augmented sleep-associated delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–12 Hz) and ripple (150–250 Hz) oscillations; and (2) stabilization of CA1 neurons’ functional connectivity patterns. Rhythmic activation of PV+ interneurons increases CA1 network coherence and leads to a sustained increase in the strength and stability of functional connections between neurons. Our results suggest that immediately following learning, PV+ interneurons drive CA1 oscillations and reactivation of CA1 ensembles, which directly promotes network plasticity and long-term memory formation.},

It is among the most common causes of mental deficits today. Those impacted are left to rely on advances in our understanding of the nature of early  alcohol-induced disorders toward human therapies. Research findings over the last decade have developed a model where ethanol-induced neurodegeneration impacts early neural circuit development, thereby perpetuating subsequent integration and plasticity in vulnerable brain regions. Here we review our current knowledge of FASD neuropathology based on discoveries of long-lasting neurophysiological effects of acute developmental ethanol exposure in animal models. We discuss the important balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition in normal neural network function, and relate the significance of that balance to human FASD as well as related disease states. Finally, we postulate that excitation/inhibition imbalance caused by early ethanol-induced neurodegeneration results in perturbed local and regional network signaling and therefore neurobehavioral pathology.},

	abstract = {The medial prefrontal cortex has been associated with diverse functions including attentional processes, visceromotor activity, decision-making, goal-directed behavior, and working memory. The present report compares and contrasts projections from the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortices in the rat by using the anterograde anatomical tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. With the exception of common projections to parts of the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, olfactory forebrain, and midline thalamus, PL and IL distribute very differently throughout the brain. Main projection sites of IL are: 1) the lateral septum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, medial and lateral preoptic nuclei, substantia innominata, and endopiriform nuclei of the basal forebrain; 2) the medial, basomedial, central, and cortical nuclei of amygdala; 3) the dorsomedial, lateral, perifornical, posterior, and supramammillary nuclei of hypothalamus; and 4) the parabrachial and solitary nuclei of the brainstem. By contrast, PL projects at best sparingly to each of these structures. Main projection sites of PL are: the agranular insular cortex, claustrum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, the paraventricular, mediodorsal, and reuniens nuclei of thalamus, the capsular part of the central nucleus and the basolateral nucleus of amygdala, and the dorsal and median raphe nuclei of the brainstem. As discussed herein, the pattern of IL projections is consistent with a role for IL in the control of visceral/autonomic activity homologous to the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex of primates, whereas those of PL are consistent with a role for PL in limbic-cognitive functions homologous to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of primates.

Relying on the giant depolarizing potentials that provide most of the synaptic activity in the developing hippocampus, this article reviews the common properties and generating mechanisms of these patterns, and particularly the role of the early depolarizing action of GABAA and glycine receptors and the sequential expression of GABA and glutamate synapses. Patterns similar to giant depolarizing potentials have been observed in a wide range of structures and species suggesting that there is a temporal template throughout evolution that constitutes an essential step in the formation of functional networks.},

	abstract = {The developmental aspects of hippocampal electrical activity and motor behavior were studied in freely moving infant rats implanted with microelectrodes in the CA1 and dentate regions. The pup's motor abilities developed concomitantly with hippocampal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. The uncoordinated and limited locomotion of 6- to 9-day-old pups was associated with very low-amplitude, low-frequency, irregular activity, similar to that accompanying immobility. Starting at 10 days, the EEG-behavior correlation described by Vanderwolf and his colleagues became evident: Voluntary movements were associated with hippocampal theta rhythm whereas immobility was associated with irregular activity. A second, lower-frequency type of theta, not correlated with movement, also appeared at 10 days. It was induced by anticholnesterase drugs and abolished by anticholinergics. Administration of anticholinergics caused minor disruption of movement-related theta, especially in younger animals. Observations of tonic and phasic REM sleep also demonstrated that the two types of theta activity appeared at 10 days of age. Despite the difference in the time course of morphogenesis, the prenatally formed CA1 pyramidal region and the postnatally formed dentate granule region developed in parallel with respect to the appearance of both types of theta activity at about 10 days. Theta frequency and amplitude developed to adult values during the next 2 weeks, but the activity in CA1 remained smaller than in the dentate region. The study thus supported the hypothesis that there are two main generators of theta activity, the CA1 pyramidal region and the dentate region.},

	abstract = {Background: Exposure to ethanol (EtOH) in utero alters the disposition of tangentially migrating GABAergic interneurons in the fetal brain. The medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) gives rise to a large portion of cortical GABAergic interneurons, including the parvalbumin-expressing interneurons that shape and contribute to inhibitory/excitatory (I/E) balance of the intracortical circuit. Here, we investigated in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) the hypothesis that low levels of maternal EtOH consumption from closure of the neural tube embryonic day (E) 9.5 until birth result in an enduring interneuronopathy.
Methods: Pregnant mice were subjected to a 2\% w/w EtOH consumption regimen starting at neural tube closure and ending at parturition. Neurogenesis in the MGE was assessed by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) immunoﬂuorescence at E12.5. The count and distribution of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons were determined in adult animals, and patch clamp electrophysiology was performed to determine GABAergic function and I/E balance. Open-ﬁeld behavior in adult mice was assessed to determine whether the EtOH-exposed cohort displayed a lasting alteration in exploratory behavior.
Results: In embryos exposed to EtOH in utero, we found increased BrdU labeling in the MGE, pointing to increased neurogenesis. Adult mice prenatally exposed to EtOH were hyperactive, and this was associated with an increase in parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons in the mPFC. In addition, prenatal EtOH exposure altered the balance between spontaneous inhibitory and excitatory synaptic input and attenuated GABAergic tone in layer V mPFC pyramidal neurons in juvenile mice.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings underscore that altered migration of GABAergic interneurons contributes to the EtOH-induced aberration of cortical development and that these eﬀects persist into adulthood as altered cortical form and function.},

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acutely isolated medial septum/diagonal band (MS/DB) neurons were used to define effects of rapidly applied ethanol and other allosteric modulators on bicuculline-sensitive GABA currents. Three age groups were examined including `pups' (PD 4–10), `juveniles' (PD 11–16) and `young adults' (PD 25–35). In untreated neurons, maximum responses to GABA and the apparent GABA EC50 increased ∼2-fold during the first month of life. Potentiation of GABA responses by pentobarbital, midazolam, and loreclezole all increased with age, while Zn2+ inhibition declined. Initial inhibition by ethanol switched to potentiation of GABA responses during this time. In vivo, binge-like ethanol treatment (4.5 g kg−1 day−1 divided into two doses, 2 h apart on PD 4–9) reduced both the GABA maximal response and GABA EC50 measured on PD 11–16. These measures returned to control levels by PD 25–35. After binge-like postnatal ethanol exposure, age-dependent loss of Zn2+ inhibition of GABA responses was increased, while potentiating actions of in vitro ethanol were blocked. GABAAR modulation by other drugs was unaffected. These data suggest that early postnatal ethanol exposure disrupts the expected developmental pattern of GABAAR function in MS/DB neurons, an action that could contribute to neurobehavioral deficits associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome. Whether these changes are due to cellular damage, delayed gene expression or post-translational modification needs to be determined.},

Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs) support consolidation of recently acquired episodic memories and planning future actions by generating ordered neuronal sequences of previous or future experiences. SPW-Rs are characterized by several spectral components: a slow (5–15 Hz) sharp-wave, a high-frequency “ripple” oscillation (150–200 Hz), and a slow “gamma” oscillation (20–40 Hz). Using laminar hippocampal recordings and optogenetic manipulations, we dissected the origin of these spectral components. We show that increased power in the 20–40 Hz band does not reflect an entrainment of CA1 and CA3 neurons at gamma frequency but the power envelope of overlapping ripples. Spike-local field potential coupling between unit firing in CA1 and CA3 regions during SPW-Rs is lowest in the gamma band. Longer SPW-Rs are preceded by increased firing in the entorhinal cortex. Thus, fusion of SPW-Rs leads to lengthening of their duration associated with increased power in the slow gamma band without the presence of true oscillation.},

Theta-gamma phase coupling and spike timing within theta oscillations are prominent features of the hippocampus and are often related to navigation and memory. However, the mechanisms that give rise to these relationships are not well understood. Using high spatial resolution electrophysiology, we investigated the influence of CA3 and entorhinal inputs on the timing of CA1 neurons. The theta-phase preference and excitatory strength of the afferent CA3 and entorhinal inputs effectively timed the principal neuron activity, as well as regulated distinct CA1 interneuron populations in multiple tasks and behavioral states. Feedback potentiation of distal dendritic inhibition by CA1 place cells attenuated the excitatory entorhinal input at place field entry, coupled with feedback depression of proximal dendritic and perisomatic inhibition, allowing the CA3 input to gain control toward the exit. Thus, upstream inputs interact with local mechanisms to determine theta-phase timing of hippocampal neurons to support memory and spatial navigation.},

	abstract = {The laterodorsal nucleus (LDN) of the thalamus provides a prominent afferent projection to the postsubiculum (dorsal presubiculum). To characterize synaptic transmission in this pathway, we placed stimulating electrodes in the LDN and recorded fEPSPs elicited in the postsubiculum of urethane-anesthetized rats. LDN stimulation elicited a source-sink dipole between the deep and superﬁcial layers of the postsubiculum, respectively, consistent with anatomical evidence for the termination of thalamic afferents in the superﬁcial layers of the structure, and the existence of deep layer neurons with apical dendrites extending into these layers. Postsubicular fEPSPs were typically 0.5–1.0 mV in amplitude, with a peak latency of approximately 6 ms. Consistent with anatomical observations, the short onset latency of fEPSPs elicited by LDN stimulation, and their ability to follow a 60-Hz train of stimulation, indicate that the projection is monosynaptic. Paired-pulse stimulation revealed pronounced paired-pulse depression that was maximal at 100 ms, suggesting that initial release probabilities are high at LDNpostsubiculum synapses, in common with many neocortical pathways. A conventional tetanus protocol that yields LTP in hippocampal pathways had no effect on postsubicular fEPSPs, but longterm depression could be induced by 60-Hz stimulation. Drug infusion studies revealed that synaptic transmission in the LDN-postsubiculum projection is predominantly AMPA-receptor mediated. Rats were implanted with indwelling infusion cannulae targeting the postsubiculum, and, after a recovery period, were anaesthetized with urethane, and implanted with stimulating and recording electrodes. Infusion of CNQX almost completely abolished postsubicular fEPSPs, whereas D-AP5 had little effect. However, 60-Hz LTD was blocked by D-AP5 infusion, revealing that this form of synaptic plasticity is NMDA-receptor dependent. VC 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {A rat's proclivity to explore a novel environment presents a behaviorally rich paradigm to investigate the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation. Here we describe a novel technique of behavioral analysis that is derived from a single exploratory trip. An exploratory trip was defined as a rat's departure from the home base that ended when the rat returned to the home base. The behavior observed on a single exploratory trip by a control animal is highly organized into outward and homeward segments. An outward segment is characterized by a slow circuitous progression from the home base marked by several stops. A homeward segment is characterized by a rapid direct return to the home base. The velocity attribute of the exploratory trip was quantified by estimating the point of inflection associated with the trip's cumulative moment-to-moment velocity distribution. The heading direction and variance of the homeward trip segment was analyzed with circular statistics. A comparison of the exploratory behavior of control animals and animals with damage to the fimbria-fornix indicated that the velocity and heading direction of the homeward portion of the trip depends upon the hippocampal formation. While control and fimbria-fornix rats had similar outward segments, the return paths of the fimbria-fornix rats were significantly slower, more circuitous, and more variable compared with that of the control rats. This result was also independent of testing in light or dark conditions. The lack of dependence on allothetic cues suggests that rats employ dead reckoning navigational strategies to initiate the homeward portion of exploratory movements. Methods to quantify exploratory behavior in terms of velocity and angular components provide an assessment of control behavior and the assessment of the behavior of rats with hippocampal formation damage that is easy to implement.},

	abstract = {Summary The capacity to construct a cognitive map is hypothesized to rest on two foundations: (1) dead reckoning (path integration); (2) the perception of the direction and distance of terrain features relative to the animal. A map may be constructed by combining these two sources of positional information, with the result that the positions of all terrain features are represented in the coordinate framework used for dead reckoning. When animals need to become reoriented in a mapped space, results from rats and human toddlers indicate that they focus exclusively on the shape of the perceived environment, ignoring non-geometric features such as surface colors. As a result, in a rectangular space, they are misoriented half the time even when the two ends of the space differ strikingly in their appearance. In searching for a hidden object after becoming reoriented, both kinds of subjects search on the basis of the object’s mapped position in the space rather than on the basis of its relationship to a goal sign (e.g. a distinctive container or nearby marker), even though they have demonstrably noted the relationship between the goal and the goal sign. When choosing a multidestination foraging route, vervet monkeys look at least three destinations ahead, even though they are only capable of keeping a maximum of six destinations in mind at once.},

	abstract = {The prefrontal cortex mediates adaption to changing environmental contingencies. The anterior thalamic nuclei, which are closely interconnected with the prefrontal cortex, are important for rodent spatial memory, but their potential role in executive function has received scant attention. The current study examined whether the anterior thalamic nuclei are involved in attentional processes akin to those of prefrontal regions. Remarkably, the results repeatedly revealed attentional properties opposite to those of the prefrontal cortex. Two separate cohorts of rats with anterior thalamic lesions were tested on an attentional set-shifting paradigm that measures not only the ability of stimuli dimensions that reliably predict reinforcement to gain attention (“intradimensional shift”), but also their ability to shift attention to another stimulus dimension when contingencies change (“extradimensional shift”). In stark contrast to the effects of prefrontal damage, anterior thalamic lesions impaired intradimensional shifts but facilitated extradimensional shifts. Anterior thalamic lesion animals were slower to acquire discriminations based on the currently relevant stimulus dimension but acquired discriminations involving previously irrelevant stimulus dimensions more rapidly than controls. Subsequent tests revealed that the critical determinant of whether anterior thalamic lesions facilitate extradimensional shifts is the degree to which the stimulus dimension has been established as an unreliable predictor of reinforcement over preceding trials. This pattern of performance reveals that the anterior thalamic nuclei are vital for attending to those stimuli that are the best predictors of reward. In their absence, unreliable predictors of reward usurp attentional control.},

However, the organization of reciprocal corticothalamic projections has not yet been studied comprehensively. In the present study, we clarified the organization of anterior cingulate and frontal cortical projections to the anterior and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei, using retrograde and anterograde axonal transport methods. The anteromedial nucleus (AM) receives mainly ipsilateral projections from the prelimbic and medial orbital cortices and bilateral projections from the anterior cingulate and secondary motor cortices. The projections from the anterior cingulate cortex are organized such that the rostrocaudal axis of the AM corresponds to the rostrocaudal axis of the cortex, whereas those from the secondary motor cortex are organized such that the rostrocaudal axis of the AM corresponds to the caudorostral axis of the cortex. The ventromedial part of the anteroventral nucleus receives ipsilateral projections from the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral projections from the secondary motor cortex, in a topographic manner similar to the projections to the AM. The ventromedial part of the laterodorsal nucleus (LD) receives ipsilateral projections from the anterior cingulate and secondary motor cortices. The projections are roughly organized such that more dorsal and ventral regions within the ventromedial LD receive projections preferentially from the anterior cingulate cortex. The difference in anterior cingulate and frontal cortical projections to the anterior and laterodorsal nuclei may suggest that each thalamic nucleus plays a different functional role in spatial memory processing.},

	abstract = {Currently, testosterone (T) replacement therapy is typically provided by oral medication, injectable T esters, surgically implanted T pellets, transdermal patches and gels. However, most of these methods of administration are still not ideal for targeting the central nervous system. Recently, therapeutic intranasal T administration (InT) has been considered as another option for delivering T to the brain. In the present study, the effects of 21-day InT treatment were assessed on open field behavior in gonadectomized (GDX) rats and intact rats. Subcutaneous injections of T at same dose were also tested in GDX rats. A total of 12 behavioral events were examined in GDX groups with or without T and in intact groups with or without InT. Significant decreases in open field activity were observed in rats after GDX without InT compared to sham-operated rats. The open field activity scores for most tests significantly increased with InT treatment in GDX rats and in intact rats compared with the corresponding GDX rats and intact rats. Intranasal administration of T improved the reduced behaviors resulted from T deficiency better than subcutaneous injection of T, demonstrating that T can be delivered to the brain by intranasal administration. Our results suggest that intranasal T delivery is an effective option for targeting the central nervous system.},

	abstract = {When given a locomotor/exploratory test in the laboratory, rats form one or more home bases, operationally defined as places where they spend a disproportionate period of their time and from which they make excursions. Because exploratory tests in the laboratory necessarily restrict the animals’ movements, the cause of exploration (e.g., fear, curiosity, innate disposition) and the extent to which organization is imposed by the restriction of the testing environment has not been fully examined. In the present study, rats received exploratory tests in environments in which restrictions were remote; in a parking lot or on a playing field. Each rat began a test in one of three conditions: in a small refuge, within a transparent open home cage, or beside a landmark. In the parking lot, the rats failed to leave the small refuge, made excursions from the home cage, and left the landmark, usually at a gallop, and made no movements of returning. On the playing field they remained in the small refuge, left and returned to the open home cage, and were more likely to permanently leave the landmark at a gallop. Rats that displayed a strong preference for the landmark over three test sessions in a laboratory, also immediately left the same landmark when tested on the playing field. The pattern of behavior, in which the rats failed to explore from a secure starting position and were increasingly likely to run away as security decreased, suggests that a primary function of locomotor behavior in a novel environment is to optimize security. The results are discussed in relation to the advantages of investigating the influence of neural processes on exploration in terms optimization theory versus motivational theory.},

In previous work, one or two places termed home bases, were shown to stand out from all the other places in the environment in terms of the behaviors performed in them and in terms of their behavioral stability. We use home base location as a reference place for rat movement in locale space, by defining an excursion as a trip starting at a home base and ending at the next stop at a home base. We then establish the uniform distribution as an appropriate model for the number of stops per excursion. This way we show that there is an intrinsic upper bound on the number of times a rat stops during an excursion. As a rat leaves the home base, home base attraction increases with every additional stop performed by it, first slowly and then fast. This cumulative process of attraction may be concluded after each stop, as long as the number of stops does not exceed an intrinsic upper bound; once the upper bound is reached, the rat concludes that excursion and returns to base. The session's upper bound does not increase with the size of the explored area.},

We recorded place cells in rats and found that increased neural activity during exploratory head-scanning behaviors predicted the formation and potentiation of place fields on the next pass through that location, regardless of environmental familiarity and across multiple testing days. These results strongly suggest that, during the attentive behaviors that punctuate exploration, place cell activity mediates the one-trial encoding of ongoing experiences necessary for episodic memory.},

	abstract = {Summary During short excursions away from home, some mammals are known to update their position with respect to their point of departure through path integration (dead reckoning) by processing internal (idiothetic) signals generated by rotations and translations. Path integration (PI) is a continuously ongoing process in which errors accumulate. To remain functional over longer excursions, PI needs to be reset through position information from stable external references. We tested the homing behaviour of golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus W.) during hoarding excursions following a rotation of the arena and nest. In continuous darkness, the hamsters returned to their point of departure at the rotated nest, and therefore depended on PI only. In other trials, the animals were brieﬂy presented with visual room cues during or at the end of the outward trip, visual cues being pitted by 67° or 98° against the animal’s current selfgenerated position vector. After a ﬁx, the animals headed for the usual (unrotated) nest location, as deﬁned by room cues, independent of the timing of the ﬁx. These results were obtained in two different geometrical settings and showed that, after the ﬁx, the animals update their position, and not merely their head direction or internal compass, in a new reference frame. Thus, episodic ﬁxes on familiar external references reset the PI and therefore greatly enhance the functional signiﬁcation of navigation that is based on feedback information from locomotion.},

	abstract = {Although β-amyloid plaques are a well-recognized hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, no drugs reducing amyloid burden have shown efficacy in clinical trials, suggesting that once AD symptoms emerge, disease progression becomes independent of Aβ production. Reactive astrocytes are another neuropathological feature of AD, where there is an emergence of neurotoxic (A1) reactive astrocytes. We find that serine racemase (SR), the neuronal enzyme that produces the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) co-agonist d-serine, is robustly expressed in A1-reactive neurotoxic astrocytes in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of AD subjects and an AD rat model. Furthermore, we observe intracellular signaling changes consistent with increased extra-synaptic NMDAR activation, excitotoxicity and decreased neuronal survival. Thus, reducing neurotoxic d-serine release from A1 inflammatory astrocytes could have therapeutic benefit for mild to advanced AD, when anti-amyloid strategies are ineffective.},

We demonstrate how it can become an asset offering a quantitative criterion that guides the design of better ways to describe behavior. Passing the high benchmark dictated by the replicability demand requires less stressful and less restraining experimental setups, less noisy data, individually customized cutoff points between the building blocks of movement, and less variable yet discriminative dynamic representations that would capture more faithfully the nature of the behavior, unmasking similarities and differences and revealing novel animal-centered measures. Here we review ten tools that enhance replicability without compromising discrimination. While we demonstrate the usefulness of these tools in the context of inbred mouse exploratory behavior they can readily be used in any study involving a high-resolution analysis of spatial behavior. Viewing replicability as a design concept and using the ten methodological improvements may prove useful in many ﬁelds not necessarily related to spatial behavior.},

Although home bases are preferentially formed near distinctive cues, including visual cues, animals also visit and pause and move slowly, or linger, at many other locations in a test environment. In order to further examine the organization of exploratory behavior, the present study examined the influence of the point of entry on animals placed on an open field table that was illuminated either by room light or infrared light (a wavelength in which they cannot see) and near which, or on which, distinctive cues were placed. The main findings were that in both room light and infrared light tests, rats visited and lingered at the point of entry significantly more often than comparative control locations. Although the rats also visited and lingered in the vicinity of salient visual cues, the point of entry still remained a focus of visits. Finally, the preference for the point of entry increased as a function of salience of the cues marking that location. That the point of entry influences the organization of exploratory behavior is discussed in relation to the idea that the exploratory behavior of the rat is directed toward optimizing security as well as forming a spatial representation of the environment.},

	abstract = {Spatial theory proposes that the hippocampus contributes to exploratory behavior allowing animals to acquire information about their environment. In the present study, the exploratory movements of control rats, bulbectomized (anosmic) rats and hippocampectomized rats using the neurotoxin N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) were monitored on a large circular table without walls and around which visual cues were manipulated. The rats displayed organized spatial behavior in that they developed home bases, one or more places operationally deﬁned as those in which they spent a preponderance of time, in which they moved slowly, and to which they returned after excursions. Control rats and hippocampectomized rats were similar in that they established home bases: (i) adjacent to a proximal stable or moving visual landmark; (ii) in relation to more distant visual room cues; and (iii) in relation to contextually conditioned visual cues. Nevertheless, in exploratory tests given under infrared light, a wavelength to which rats are insensitive, control rats and bulbectomized rats established one or more home bases that were not dependent upon surface (e.g. olfactory) cues, whereas home base behavior was absent ⁄ fragmented in hippocampectomized rats. Thus, exploratory behavior, as exempliﬁed by home base behavior, is organized in control and hippocampectomized rats in relation to visual cues, but is not organized in hippocampectomized rats when visual cues are absent. This result is discussed in relation to the idea that the hippocampus contributes to spatial behavior that is dependent upon guidance (dead reckoning) derived from self-movement cues.},

	abstract = {Rats use multiple sources of information to maintain spatial orientation. Although previous work has focused on rats’ use of environmental cues, a growing number of studies have demonstrated that rats also use self-movement cues to organize navigation. This review examines the extent that kinematic analysis of naturally occurring behavior has provided insight into processes that mediate dead-reckoning-based navigation. This work supports a role for separate systems in processing self-movement cues that converge on the hippocampus. The compass system is involved in deriving directional information from self-movement cues; whereas, the odometer system is involved in deriving distance information from self-movement cues. The hippocampus functions similar to a logbook in that outward path unique information from the compass and odometer is used to derive the direction and distance of a path to the point at which movement was initiated. Finally, home base establishment may function to reset this system after each excursion and anchor environmental cues to self-movement cues. The combination of natural behaviors and kinematic analysis has proven to be a robust paradigm to investigate the neural basis of spatial orientation.},

	abstract = {Animals navigate using cues generated by their own movements (self-movement cues or idiothetic cues), as well as the cues they encounter in their environment (distal cues or allothetic cues). Animals use these cues to navigate in two different ways. When dead reckoning (deduced reckoning or path integration), they integrate self-movement cues over time to locate a present position or to return to a starting location. When piloting, they use allothetic cues as beacons, or they use the relational properties of allothetic cues to locate places in space. The neural structures involved in cue use and navigational strategies are still poorly understood, although considerable attention is directed toward the contributions of the hippocampal formation (hippocampus and associated pathways and structures, including the ﬁmbria-fornix and the retrosplenial cortex). In the present study, using tests in allothetic and idiothetic paradigms, we present four lines of evidence to support the hypothesis that the hippocampal formation plays a central role in dead reckoning. (1) Control but not ﬁmbria-fornix lesion rats can return to a novel refuge location in both light and dark (infrared) food carrying tasks. (2). Control but not ﬁmbria-fornix lesion rats make periodic direct high velocity returns to a starting location in both light and dark exploratory tests. Control but not ﬁmbria-fornix rats trained in the light to carry food from a ﬁxed location to a refuge are able to maintain accurate outward and homebound trajectories when tested in the dark. (3). Control but not ﬁmbria-fornix rats are able to correct an outward trajectory to a food source when the food source is moved when allothetic cues are present. These, tests of spontaneous exploration and foraging suggest a role for the hippocampal formation in dead reckoning. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are characterized by the formation of mature tangles in the entorhinal cortex and disorientation and confusion when navigating familiar places. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) contains specialized neurons called grid cells that form part of the spatial navigation system. Here we show in a transgenic mouse model expressing mutant human tau predominantly in the EC that the formation of mature tangles in old mice was associated with excitatory cell loss and deficits in grid cell function, including destabilized grid fields and reduced firing rates, as well as altered network activity. Overt tau pathology in the aged mice was accompanied by spatial memory deficits. Therefore, tau pathology initiated in the entorhinal cortex could lead to deficits in grid cell firing and underlie the deterioration of spatial cognition seen in human AD.},

	abstract = {Background
In addition to cognitive deficits, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with other neuropsychiatric symptoms, including severe depression. Indeed, depression often precedes cognitive deficits in patients with AD. Unfortunately, the field has seen only minimal therapeutic advances, underscoring the critical need for new treatments. P7C3 aminopropyl carbazoles promote neuronal survival by enhancing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide flux in injured neurons. Neuroprotection with P7C3 compounds has been demonstrated in preclinical models of neurodegeneration by virtue of promoting neuronal survival independently of early disease-specific pathology, resulting in protection from cognitive deficits and depressive-like behavior. We hypothesize that P7C3 compounds might be uniquely applicable to patients with AD, given the comorbid presentation of depression and cognitive deficits.
Methods
Aging male and female wild-type and TgF344-AD rats, a well-characterized preclinical AD model, were administered (−)-P7C3-S243 daily for 9 and 18 months, beginning at 6 months of age. Behavioral phenotypes related to cognition and depression were assessed at 15 and 24 months, and brain pathology and biochemistry were assessed at 24 months.
Results
(−)-P7C3-S243 safely protected aging male and female wild-type and TgF344-AD rats from cognitive deficits and depressive-like behavior. Depressive-like behavior occurred earlier than cognitive deficits in TgF344-AD rats, consistent with AD in many patients. Treatment with (−)-P7C3-S243 blocked neurodegeneration in TgF344-AD rats, without altering amyloid deposition or indicators of neuroinflammation.
Conclusions
Neuronal cell death–specific treatment approaches, such as P7C3 compounds, may represent a new treatment approach for patients experiencing the combination of cognitive deficits and depression associated with AD.},

Preclinical studies on neuronal impairments associated with progressive amyloidosis have demonstrated some Aβ-dependent neuronal dysfunction including modulation of GABAergic signalling. The present work focuses on the early stage of disease progression and uses TgF344-AD rats that recapitulate a broad repertoire of AD-like pathologies to investigate the neuronal network functioning using simultaneous intracranial recordings from the hippocampus (HPC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), followed by pathological analyses of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors subunits α1, α5 and δ, and glutamic acid decarboxylases (GAD65 and GAD67). Concomitant to amyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, low-gamma band power was strongly attenuated in the HPC and mPFC of TgF344-AD rats in comparison to those in non-transgenic littermates. In addition, the phaseamplitude coupling of the neuronal networks in both areas was impaired, evidenced by decreased modulation of theta band phase on gamma band amplitude in TgF344-AD animals. Finally, the gamma coherence between HPC and mPFC was attenuated as well. These results demonstrate significant neuronal network dysfunction at an early stage of AD-like pathology.

	abstract = {Similar to elderly humans, aged outbred Long-Evans rats exhibit individual differences in memory abilities, including a subset of aged rats that maintain memory function on par with young adults. Such individuals provide a basis for investigating mechanisms of resilience to age-related decline. The present study examined hippocampal gene expression in young adults and aged rats with preserved memory function under behavioral task conditions well established for assessing information processing central to the formation of episodic memory. Although behavioral measures and hippocampal gene induction associated with neural activity and synaptic plasticity were similar across age groups, a marker for inhibitory interneuron function in the hippocampal formation was distinctively increased only in aged rats but not in young adults. Because heightened hippocampal neural activity is associated with agerelated memory impairment across species, including rats, monkeys, and humans, this ﬁnding may represent an adaptive homeostatic adjustment necessary to maintain neural plasticity and memory function in aging.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology begins decades prior to onset of clinical symptoms, and the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus are among the ﬁrst and most extensively impacted brain regions. The TgF344-AD rat model, which more fully recapitulates human AD pathology in an age-dependent manner, is a next generation preclinical rodent model for understanding pathophysiological processes underlying the earliest stages of AD (Cohen et al., 2013). Whether synaptic alterations occur in hippocampus prior to reported learning and memory deﬁcit is not known. Furthermore, it is not known if speciﬁc hippocampal synapses are diﬀerentially aﬀected by progressing AD pathology, or if synaptic deﬁcits begin to appear at the same age in males and females in this preclinical model. Here, we investigated the time-course of synaptic changes in basal transmission, paired-pulse ratio, as an indirect measure of presynaptic release probability, long-term potentiation (LTP), and dendritic spine density at two hippocampal synapses in male and ovariectomized female TgF344-AD rats and wildtype littermates, prior to reported behavioral deﬁcits. Decreased basal synaptic transmission begins at medial perforant path-dentate granule cell (MPP-DGC) synapses prior to Schaﬀer-collateral-CA1 (CA3-CA1) synapses, in the absence of a change in paired-pulse ratio (PPR) or dendritic spine density. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent LTP magnitude is unaﬀected at CA3-CA1 synapses at 6, 9, and 12 months of age, but is signiﬁcantly increased at MPP-DGC synapses in TgF344-AD rats at 6 months only. Sex diﬀerences were only observed at CA3-CA1 synapses where the decrease in basal transmission occurs at a younger age in males versus females. These are the ﬁrst studies to deﬁne presymptomatic alterations in hippocampal synaptic transmission in the TgF344-AD rat model. The time course of altered synaptic transmission mimics the spread of pathology through hippocampus in human AD and provides support for this model as a valuable preclinical tool in elucidating pathological mechanisms of early synapse dysfunction in AD.},

However, in many ways the retrosplenial cortex remains understudied. Here, we sought to characterize spatial correlates of neurons within the region during free exploration in two-dimensional environments. We report that a large percentage of retrosplenial cortex neurons have spatial receptive fields that are active when environmental boundaries are positioned at a specific orientation and distance relative to the animal itself. We demonstrate that this vector-based location signal is encoded in egocentric coordinates, localized to the dysgranular retrosplenial sub-region, independent of self-motion, and context invariant. Further, we identify a sub-population of neurons with this response property that are synchronized with the hippocampal theta oscillation. Accordingly, the current work identifies a robust egocentric spatial code in retrosplenial cortex that can facilitate spatial coordinate system transformations and support the anchoring, generation, and utilization of allocentric representations.},

	abstract = {Single cells in the rat anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) and postsubiculum (PoS) discharge as a function of the rat's directional heading in the horizontal plane, independent of its location. A previous study that compared cell firing during clockwise and counterclockwise head turns concluded that ATN ‘head direction’ (HD) cell discharge anticipates the rat's future directional heading, while PoS HD cell discharge is in register with the rat's current directional heading (Blair and Sharp [1995] J Neurosci 15:6260–6270). In the current study we extend these findings by using a different method of analysis. HD cells in the ATN and PoS were first characterized by three different measures: peak firing rate, range width, and information content. We then examined how these measures varied when cell firing was aligned with past (negative time shift) or future (positive time shift) head direction of the rat. We report that all three measures were optimized when ATN cell firing was aligned with the animal's future directional heading by about +23 msec. In contrast, PoS HD cell firing was optimized when cell firing was aligned with the rat's past head direction by about -7 msec. When the optimal value was plotted as a function of the amount of time spikes were shifted relative to head orientation, the mean ATN function was shifted to the right of the PoS function only at negative time shifts; at positive time shifts the two functions overlapped. Analysis of two recording sessions from the same cell indicated that each cell in a particular brain area is ‘tuned’ to a specific time shift so that all cells within a brain area are not uniformly tuned to the same time shift. Other analyses showed that the clockwise and counterclockwise tuning functions were not skewed in the direction of the head turn as postulated by Redish et al. ([1996] Network: Computation in Neural Systems 7:671–685) and Blair et al. ([1997] J Neurophysiol 17:145–159). Additional analysis on episodes when the rat happened to continually point its head in the preferred direction indicated that HD cell firing undergoes little adaptation. In the Discussion, we argue that these results are best accounted for by a motor efference copy signal operating on both types of HD cells such that the copy associated with the PoS HD cells is delayed in time by about 30 msec relative to the copy associated with ATN HD cells.

	abstract = {Hippocampal place cells are selectively active when a rat occupies restricted locations in an environment, and head direction cells fire selectively when the rat’s head is pointed in a particular direction in allocentric space. Both place cells and head direction cells are usually coupled, and they are controlled by a complex interaction between external landmarks and idiothetic cues. Most studies have investigated this interaction by rotating the landmarks in the environment. In contrast, a recent study translated the apparatus relative to the landmarks in an environment and found that most place cells maintained the same preferred location on the apparatus regardless of the location of the apparatus in the room. Because head direction cells are insensitive to the rat’s location in an environment, the distal landmarks may influence the place field firing locations primarily by controlling the bearing of the head direction cell system. To address this question, ensembles of CA1 place cells and head direction cells of the anterior thalamus were recorded simultaneously, as a rectangular or circular track was moved to different locations in a room with distinct visual landmarks. Most place cells maintained their firing fields relative to the track when the track was translated, and head direction cells maintained the same preferred firing direction. When the distal landmarks were rotated around the track, the firing fields of place cells and the preferred directions of head direction cells rotated with the cues. These results suggest that the precise firing locations of place cells are controlled by an interaction between local and idiothetic cues, and the orientation of the CA1 ensemble representation relative to the distal landmarks may be controlled indirectly by the distal landmarks’ influence over the bearing of the head direction cell system.},

The experimental data were derived from a large number of neurons throughout all layers. The majority of spikes were biphasic, with a dominant negative peak (mean amplitude, −0.11 mV), whereas a minority of APs had a dominant positive peak of +0.54-mV mean amplitude, with a maximum of +1.5 mV. The largest positive amplitude spikes were recorded in layer 5. The simulations demonstrated that a pyramidal neuron under known biophysical conditions may generate a negative peak with amplitude up to −1.5 mV, but that the amplitude of the positive peak may be at most 0.5 mV. We confirmed that spikes with large positive peaks were not produced by juxtacellular patch recordings. We conclude that there is a significant gap in our present understanding of either the spike-generation process in pyramidal neurons, the biophysics of extracellular recording, or both.},

The importance of fast synaptic recruitment and action potential initiation and repolarization, and rapid synchronous GABA release by PV+ cells, is well established. In contrast, the functional significance of PV+ cell NMDA receptors (NMDARs), which generate relatively slow postsynaptic currents, is unclear. Underlining their potential importance, several studies implicate PV+ cell NMDAR disruption in impaired network function and circuit pathologies. Here, we show that dendritic NMDARs underlie supralinear integration of feedback excitation from local pyramidal neurons onto mouse CA1 PV+ cells. Furthermore, by incorporating NMDARs at feedback connections onto PV+ cells in spiking networks, we show that these receptors enable cooperative recruitment of PV+ interneurons, strengthening and stabilising principal cell assemblies. Failure of this phenomenon provides a parsimonious explanation for cognitive and sensory gating deficits in pathologies with impaired PV+ NMDAR signalling.},

So far, it is less clear whether and how the direction threshold is altered in AD. Here we asked a group of AD patients and two control groups of healthy participants (young and elderly adults) to judge their perceived heading direction based on a field of optic flow stimuli simulating a forward translation in the environment. We manipulated the heading direction and the coherence of the optic flow independently and measured the direction and coherence thresholds from each participant. We found that the direction threshold increased significantly in AD patients as compared to healthy controls, like the coherence threshold. Yet, the elevation in the direction threshold was less pronounced than the coherence threshold. Moreover, the magnitudes of the direction and coherence thresholds in AD patients were not correlated. Our results suggest that coherence and direction impairments are two distinct forms of motion deficits in AD patients which might be associated with independent neural mechanisms.},

	abstract = {In early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) spatial navigation is impaired; however, the precise cause of this impairment is unclear. Recent evidence suggests that getting lost is one of the first impairments to emerge in AD. It is possible that getting lost represents a failure to use distal cues to get oriented in space. Therefore, we set out to look for impaired use of distal cues for spatial orientation in a mouse model of amyloidosis (3xTg-AD). To do this, we trained mice to shuttle to the end of a track and back to an enclosed start box to receive a water reward. Then, mice were trained to stop in an unmarked reward zone to receive a brain stimulation reward. The time required to remain in the zone for a reward was increased across training, and the track was positioned in a random start location for each trial. We found that 6-month female, but not 3-month female, 6-month male, or 12-month male, 3xTg-AD mice were impaired. 6-month male and female mice had only intracellular pathology and male mice had less pathology, particularly in the dorsal hippocampus. Thus, AD may cause spatial disorientation as a result of impaired use of landmarks.},

The brain regions underlying OT impairment remain to be elucidated. A previous single-photon emission computed tomography study has indicated hypoperfusion of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in relation to deterioration of OT. In this study, we investigated whole brain functional connectivity changes of PCC using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based functional connectivity with PCC was analyzed in OT-poor or OT-good AD patients, classified according to the mean OT scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination subscale. The connectivities of dorsal frontal lobe, and lateral parietal and lateral temporal lobes with PCC in the right hemisphere were reduced in the OT-poor AD group compared with the OT-good AD group. A subtraction connectivity map of OT score differences (OT-good minus OT-poor) revealed the right middle temporal gyrus near the temporo-parietal junction as a significantly connected region with PCC. These results suggest that the right posterior part of the middle temporal gyrus may play an important role in OT in conjunction with PCC, and that disconnection between PCC and the right ventral attention network may cause OT disturbance in AD patients.},

The relationship between cognition and years to expected clinical onset, education, age, and type of mutation was analyzed using mixed-effects models. Results showed an education-dependent and time-related cognitive decline with linear and quadratic predictors in mutation carriers. Cognitive decline began close to the expected clinical onset and was relatively rapid afterward in PSEN1 mutation carriers, whereas decline was slower and started earlier than 10 years before expected clinical onset in APP mutation carriers. In noncarriers, the decline was minimal across time in accordance with normal aging. These results suggest that phenotypes for onset and rate of cognitive decline vary with PSEN1 and APP genes, suggesting a behavioral heterogeneity in ADAD.},

The TgF344-AD rat model has been well characterized and shows molecular, behavioral and brain connectivity alterations that resemble the silent period of the pathology. Our aim was to longitudinally investigate functional brain connectivity in established resting-state networks (RSNs) obtained by independent component analysis (ICA) in a cohort of TgF344-AD and control rats every 3 months, from 5 to 18 months of age, to cover different stages of the disease. Before each acquisition, working memory performance was evaluated by the delayed non match-to-sample (DNMS) task. Differences in the temporal evolution were observed between groups in the amplitude and shape of the somatosensorial and sensorimotor networks but not in the whole default mode network (DMN). Subsequent high dimensional ICA analysis showed early alterations in the anterior DMN subnetwork activity of TgF344-AD rats compared to controls. Performance of DNMS task was positively correlated with somatosensorial network at 5 months of age in the wild-type animals but not in the Tg-F344 rats. At different time points, DMN showed negative correlation with cognitive performance in the control group while in the transgenic group the correlation was positive. In addition, behavioral differences observed at 5 months of age correlated with alterations in the posterior DMN subnetwork. We have demonstrated that functional connectivity using ICA represents a useful biomarker also in animal models of AD such as the TgF344AD rats, as it allows the identification of alterations associated with the progression of the disease, detecting differences in specific networks even at very early stages.},

However, the anatomical area of the presubiculum, is characterised by the presence of a single large evenly distributed ‘lake-like’ Aβ deposit with minimal tau deposition or accumulation of inflammatory markers. Post-mortem brain samples from sporadic AD (SAD) and familial AD (FAD) and two hereditary cerebral amyloid diseases, familial British dementia (FBD) and familial Danish dementia (FDD) were used to compare the morphology of the extracellular proteins deposited in the presubiculum compared to the entorhinal cortex. The level of tau pathology and the extent of microglial activation were quantitated in the two brain regions in SAD and FAD. Frozen tissue was used to investigate the Aβ species and proteomic differences between the two regions. Consistent with our previous investigations of FBD and FDD cases we were able to establish that the ‘lake-like’ pre-amyloid deposits of the presubiculum were not a unique feature of AD but they also found two non-Aβ amyloidosis. Comparing the presubiculum to the entorhinal cortex the number of neurofibrillary tangles and tau load were significantly reduced; there was a reduction in microglial activation; there were differences in the Aβ profiles and the investigation of the whole proteome showed significant changes in different protein pathways. In summary, understanding why the presubiculum has a different morphological appearance, biochemical and proteomic makeup compared to surrounding brain regions severely affected by neurodegeneration could lead us to understanding protective mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Background: One of the most reliable biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is hippocampal atrophy demonstrated by MRI. Based on neuropathological data showing a differential vulnerability of hippocampal subfields to AD processes, hippocampal subfield analysis could improve the diagnostic accuracy of AD or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The objective of this study was to demonstrate the difference of hippocampal subfield volumes by using automated analysis for discriminating between AD, MCI and Healthy Controls (HC). Material and Methods: Fifty-three age-matched subjects including 15 AD (mean 72.3 ± 6.9 years), 9 MCI (mean 68.4 ± 3.9 years) and 29 HC (mean 69.5 ± 5.1 years) were recruited and underwent MRI (3-Tesla) with highresolution 3D-T1W. Quantitative volumetric analysis of hippocampal subfields was performed by using Freesurfer (v. 6.0) for comparing AD, MCI and HC subjects.
Results: There was a widespread pattern of subfield atrophy. Right subiculum, right presubiculum, bilateral molecular layer, and bilateral fimbria volumes were higher diagnostic efficacy than whole hippocampal volume for discriminating AD subjects from HC or MCI subjects. Only left fimbria volume was significantly reduced in MCI subjects compared to HC (normalized volume 47.7, sensitivity=66.7\%, specificity=89.7\%, AUC 0.709). The accuracy of left fimbria as the predictor of positive amyloid PET MCI was 75\%.
Conclusion: The structural brain imaging using quantitative volumetric analysis of hippocampal subfield could be used for differentiating AD, MCI and HC. These findings may be helpful for early detection and follow up of AD and MCI patients in the clinical setting.},

	abstract = {The presubiculum plays a key role in processing and integrating spatial and head-directional information. Layer III neurons of the presubiculum provide strong projections to the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex in the rat. Our previous study revealed that the terminal distribution of efferents from layer III cells of the presubiculum was organized in a band-like fashion within the medial entorhinal cortex, and the transverse axis of these zones ran parallel to the rhinal fissure. Identifying axonal branching patterns of layer III neurons of the presubiculum is important to further elucidate the functional roles of the presubiculum. In the present study, we visualized all axonal processes and terminal distributions of single presubicular layer III neurons in the rat, using in vivo injection of a viral vector expressing membrane-targeted palmitoylation site-attached green fluorescent protein. We found that layer III of the rat presubiculum comprised multiple types of neurons (n=12) with characteristic patterns of axonal collateralization, including cortical projection neurons (n=6) and several types of intrinsic connectional neurons (n=6). Two of six cortical projection neurons provided two or three major axonal branches to the medial entorhinal cortex and formed elaborate terminal arbors within the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex. The width and axis of the area of their terminal distribution resembled that of the band-like terminal field seen in our massive-scale observation. Two of the other four cortical projection neurons gave off axonal branches to the medial entorhinal cortex and also to the subiculum, and each of the other two neurons sent axons to the subiculum or parasubiculum. Patterns of axonal arborization of six intrinsic connectional neurons were distinct from each other, with four neurons sending many axonal branches to both superficial and deep layers of the presubiculum and the other two neurons showing sparse axonal branches with terminations confined to layers III-V of the presubiculum. These data demonstrate that layer III of the rat presubiculum consists of multiple types of cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and also suggest that inputs from a single presubicular layer III neuron can directly affect a band-like zone of the medial entorhinal cortex.},

Electroencephalographic recordings in hAPP mice revealed spontaneous epileptiform discharges, indicating network hypersynchrony, primarily during reduced gamma oscillatory activity. Because this oscillatory rhythm is generated by inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) cells, network dysfunction in hAPP mice might arise from impaired PV cells. Supporting this hypothesis, hAPP mice and AD patients had decreased levels of the interneuronspeciﬁc and PV cell-predominant voltage-gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.1. Restoring Nav1.1 levels in hAPP mice by Nav1.1-BAC expression increased inhibitory synaptic activity and gamma oscillations and reduced hypersynchrony, memory deﬁcits, and premature mortality. We conclude that reduced Nav1.1 levels and PV cell dysfunction critically contribute to abnormalities in oscillatory rhythms, network synchrony, and memory in hAPP mice and possibly in AD.},

Amyloid-β (Aβ), the main protein found in amyloid plaques, can affect neuronal physiology and excitability, and several AD mouse models with memory impairments display aberrant network activity, including hyperexcitability and seizures. In this study, we investigated single cell physiology in EC and network activity in EC and dentate gyrus (DG) in the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat model, using whole-cell patch clamp recordings and voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) in acute slices. In slices from transgenic animals up to 4 months of age, the majority of the principal neurons in Layer II of EC, fan cells and stellate cells, expressed intracellular Aβ (iAβ). Whereas the electrophysiological properties of fan cells were unaltered, stellate cells were more excitable in transgenic than in control rats. Stimulation in the DG resulted in comparable patterns in both groups at three and nine months, but at 12 months, the elicited responses in the transgenic group showed a significant preference for the enclosed blade, without any change in overall excitability. Only transient changes in the local network activity were seen in the medial EC (MEC). Although the observed changes in the McGill rat model are subtle, they are specific, pointing to a differential and selective involvement of specific parts of the hippocampal circuitry in Aβ pathology.},

            . Using a novel transgenic mouse line to model the impact of hAPP/Aβ accumulation on tauopathy in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal (EC-HIPP) network, we demonstrate that hAPP aggravates EC tau aggregation and accelerates pathological tau spread into the hippocampus.

            recordings revealed a strong role for hAPP/Aβ, but not tau, in the emergence of EC neuronal hyperactivity and impaired theta rhythmicity. Chronic chemogenetic attenuation of Aβ-associated hyperactivity led to reduced hAPP/Aβ accumulation and reduced pathological tau spread into downstream hippocampus. These data strongly support the hypothesis that in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Aβ-associated hyperactivity accelerates the progression of pathological tau along vulnerable neuronal circuits, and demonstrates the utility of chronic, neuromodulatory approaches in ameliorating AD pathology

By employing in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mice expressing human Aβ and tau, we reveal a dramatic tau-dependent suppression of activity and silencing of many neurons, which dominates over Aβ-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. We show that neurofibrillary tangles are neither sufficient nor required for the silencing, which instead is dependent on soluble tau. Surprisingly, although rapidly effective in tau mice, suppression of tau gene expression was much less effective in rescuing neuronal impairments in mice containing both Aβ and tau. Together, our results reveal how Aβ and tau synergize to impair the functional integrity of neural circuits in vivo and suggest a possible cellular explanation contributing to disappointing results from anti-Aβ therapeutic trials.},

	abstract = {Theta-gamma phase coupling and spike timing within theta oscillations are prominent features of the hippocampus and are often related to navigation and memory. However, the mechanisms that give rise to these relationships are not well understood. Using high spatial resolution electrophysiology, we investigated the inﬂuence of CA3 and entorhinal inputs on the timing of CA1 neurons. The theta-phase preference and excitatory strength of the afferent CA3 and entorhinal inputs effectively timed the principal neuron activity, as well as regulated distinct CA1 interneuron populations in multiple tasks and behavioral states. Feedback potentiation of distal dendritic inhibition by CA1 place cells attenuated the excitatory entorhinal input at place ﬁeld entry, coupled with feedback depression of proximal dendritic and perisomatic inhibition, allowing the CA3 input to gain control toward the exit. Thus, upstream inputs interact with local mechanisms to determine thetaphase timing of hippocampal neurons to support memory and spatial navigation.},

EC is one of the most vulnerable regions in the brain in early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease with progressive memory impairments. Accumulating evidence from healthy behaving animals indicates gamma oscillations (30–100 Hz) as critical for mediating interactions in the circuit between EC and hippocampus. However, it is still unclear whether gamma oscillations have causal relationship with memory impairment in AD. Here we provide the first evidence that in vivo gamma oscillations in the EC are impaired in an AD mouse model. Cross-frequency coupling of gamma (30-100 Hz) oscillations to theta oscillations was reduced in the medial EC of anesthetized amyloid precursor protein knock-in mice. Phase locking of spiking activity of layer II/III pyramidal cells to the gamma oscillations was significantly impaired. These data indicate that the neural circuit activities organized by gamma oscillations were disrupted in the medial entorhinal cortex of AD mouse model, and point to gamma oscillations as one of possible mechanisms for cognitive dysfunction in AD patients.},

The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) routes spatial information whereas the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) routes predominantly olfactory information to the hippocampus. Gamma oscillations are known to coordinate information transfer between brain regions by precisely timing population activity of neuronal ensembles. Here we studied the organization of in vitro gamma oscillations in the MEC \& LEC of the transgenic (tg) APP-PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) at 4 – 5 months of age. In vitro gamma oscillations using the kainate model peaked between 30 - 50 Hz and therefore we analyzed the oscillatory properties in the 20 – 60 Hz range. Our results indicate that the LEC shows clear alterations in frequency and power of gamma oscillations early-on in AD as compared to the MEC. The gamma-frequency oscillation slows down in the LEC and also the gamma power in dorsal LEC is decreased as early as 4 – 5 months in the tg APP-PS1 mice. The results of this study suggest that the timing of olfactory inputs from LEC to the hippocampus might be affected early on in AD, resulting in a possible erroneous integration of the information carried by the two input pathways to the hippocampal subfields.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with neuronal loss not only in the hippocampus and amygdala but also in the thalamus. Anterodorsal, centromedial, and pulvinar nuclei are the main sites of degeneration in AD. Here we combined shape analysis and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to study degeneration in AD in the thalamus and its connections. Structural and diffusion tensor MRI scans were obtained from 16 AD patients and 22 demographically similar healthy volunteers. The thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala were automatically segmented using our locally developed algorithm, and group comparisons were carried out for each surface vertex. We also employed probabilistic diffusion tractography to obtain connectivity measures between individual thalamic voxels and hippocampus/amygdala voxels and to segment the internal medullary lamina (IML). Shape analysis showed significant bilateral regional atrophy in the dorsal–medial part of the thalamus in AD patients compared to controls. Probabilistic tractography demonstrated that these regions are mainly connected with the hippocampus, temporal, and prefrontal cortex. Intrathalamic FA comparisons showed reductions in the anterodorsal region of thalamus. Intrathalamic tractography from this region revealed that the IML was significantly smaller in AD patients than in controls. We suggest that these changes can be attributed to the degeneration of the anterodorsal and intralaminar nuclei, respectively. In addition, based on previous neuropathological reports, ventral and dorsal–medial shape change in the thalamus in AD patients is likely to be driven by IML atrophy. This combined shape and connectivity analysis provides MRI evidence of regional thalamic degeneration in AD.},

In this review, we discuss imaging studies published in the past 12 years that have found evidence of subcortical involvement in early-stage ADAD and/or sAD. Several papers have reported amyloid deposition in the striatum of presymptomatic ADAD mutation carriers, prior to amyloid deposition elsewhere. Altered caudate volume has also been implicated in early-stage ADAD, but findings have been variable. Less is known about subcortical involvement in sAD: the thalamus and striatum have been found to be atrophied in symptomatic patients, but their involvement in the preclinical phase remains unclear, in part due to the difficulties of studying this stage in sporadic disease. Longitudinal imaging studies comparing ADAD mutation carriers with individuals at high-risk for sAD may be needed to elucidate the significance of subcortical involvement in different AD clinical stages.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60–70\% of cases in subjects over 65 years of age. Several postulates have been put forward that relate AD neuropathology to intellectual and functional impairment. These range from free-radical-induced damage, through cholinergic dysfunction, to β-amyloid-induced toxicity. However, therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the cognitive symptoms of patients via choline supplementation, cholinergic stimulation or β-amyloid vaccination, have largely failed. A growing body of evidence suggests that perturbations in systems using the excitatory amino acid l-glutamate (l-Glu) may underlie the pathogenic mechanisms of (e.g.) hypoxia-ischemia, epilepsy, and chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington’s disease and AD. Almost all neurons in the CNS carry the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of ionotropic l-glutamate receptors, which can mediate post-synaptic Ca2+ influx. Excitotoxicity resulting from excessive activation of NMDA receptors may enhance the localized vulnerability of neurons in a manner consistent with AD neuropathology, as a consequence of an altered regional distribution of NMDA receptor subtypes. This review discusses mechanisms for the involvement of the NMDA receptor complex and its interaction with polyamines in the pathogenesis of AD. NMDA receptor antagonists have potential for the therapeutic amelioration of AD.},

Glutamate is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain and is essential to memory formation through processes such as long-term potentiation and so might be pivotal to Alzheimer disease progression. This review discusses how the glutamatergic system is impaired in Alzheimer disease and how interactions of amyloid β and glutamate influence synaptic function, tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration. Interestingly, glutamate not only influences amyloid β production, but also amyloid β can alter the levels of glutamate at the synapse, indicating that small changes in the concentrations of both molecules could influence Alzheimer disease progression. Finally, we describe how the glutamate receptor antagonist, memantine, has been used in the treatment of individuals with Alzheimer disease and discuss its effectiveness.},

Brain dysfunction can be evaluated by measuring single-neuron activity (spikes), global neural activity (local field potentials, LFPs) and the interaction between them. Considering that the dynamic interactions between the hippocampal pyramidal cells and lateral septum are important for proper structure function, we used the complete septo-hippocampal preparation from 30-day-old controls and J20-AD transgenic mice to record changes in spiking activity from the lateral septum and its relationship with LFP activity from the CA1 area. The cross-correlation analysis revealed that young J20 transgenic mice exhibit a significant reduction in coupling between lateral septum single-cell activity and neural network activity from the hippocampal CA1. Consistently, phase-lock analysis between lateral septum single-cell activity and CA1 neural network activity showed lower values in J20 transgenic mice. Similarly, the LFP- LFP coherence between CA1 and septum in the theta range showed lower values in J20 animals. Importantly, alterations were found before any detectable signs of cognitive deficits. Our data indicate that the disruption in the communication between hippocampus and rostral lateral septum is an early event in AD pathology and may contribute to the deficits observed during AD.},

The first description of spatially tuned place cell activity in area CA1 of the hippocampus suggested that spatial representations are not centered on self, but are rather allocentric. This idea is supported by extensive neurophysiological data, including temporally coordinated sequential activity during theta phase precession and sharp wave ripples. CA1 pyramidal neurons represent other information as well, such as objects, time, and events. Additionally, our recent research revealed that CA1 place cells jointly represent the spatial location of self and a conspecific, further supporting the idea of allocentric spatial representations by CA1 place cells. The neural mechanisms underlying CA1 spatial representations have long remained a mystery, but recent research examining circuit dynamics and synaptic plasticity suggests that the temporal relationships of inputs from entorhinal cortex layer III and CA3 could be critical for generating spatially tuned CA1 activity. Here, I review studies of the hippocampal representations of space and other features, and discuss the related networks and synaptic mechanisms supporting the representations of these features.},

First, 66 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease with a spectrum of dementia severity (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 0–23) were recruited and studied. Cortical metabolic activity was analyzed topographically using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections. Regression analysis was performed for each brain pixel to predict metabolic patterns of very early disease. Predictions were tested prospectively in a group of 8 patients who complained only of memory impairment without general cognitive decline (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 25 · 1) at the time of scanning but whose condition later progressed to probable Alzheimer's disease. Both results were compared to cerebral metabolic activity in 22 age-similar normal control subjects. Prediction and analysis of actual patients consistently indicated marked metabolic reduction (21–22\%) in the posterior cingulate cortex and cinguloparietal transitional area in patients with very early Alzheimer's disease. Mean metabolic reduction in the posterior cingulate cortex was significantly greater than that in the lateral neocortices or parahippocampal cortex. The result suggests a functional importance for the posterior cingulate cortex in impairment of learning and memory, which is a feature of very early Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {Previous group studies using positron emission tomography to assess resting cerebral glucose metabolism in very early Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment have identified the posterior cingulate and adjacent cingulo-parietal cortex as the first isocortical area to develop hypometabolism. We studied the profile of resting cerebral glucose metabolism in individuals with mild cognitive impairment to assess whether more specific and stereotyped regional hypometabolism would be evident across subjects. The study found that the most consistently hypometabolic region between individual subjects was a subregion of the posterior cingulate, the retrosplenial cortex (BA 29/30). This result is discussed in the context of regional connectivity, focal lesion evidence and functional activation studies of episodic memory paradigms in both normal and Alzheimer's disease groups. We propose that the retrosplenial cortex may represent a key junction between prefrontal areas involved in implementing retrieval strategies for episodic memory and hippocampal-based mnemonic processing; we therefore interpret the retrosplenial hypometabolism as a probable contributor to the memory impairment seen in mild cognitive impairment by disconnecting these two anatomical networks.},

Brain oscillatory activity is critical for cognitive function and is altered in AD patients. Recent evidence suggests that accumulation of soluble amyloid-beta (Aβ) induces reorganization of hippocampal networks. However, whether fine changes in network activity might be present at very early stages, before Aβ overproduction, remains to be determined. We therefore assessed whether theta and gamma oscillations and their cross-frequency coupling, which are known to be essential for normal memory function, were precociously altered in the hippocampus. Electrophysiological field potential recordings were performed using complete hippocampal preparations in vitro from young transgenic CRND8 mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD. Our results indicate that a significant proportion of 1-month-old TgCRND8 mice showed robust alterations of theta–gamma cross-frequency coupling in the principal output region of the hippocampus, the subiculum. In addition we showed that, compared to controls, these mice expressed negligible levels of Aβ. Finally, these network alterations were not due to genetic factors as 15-day-old animals did not exhibit theta–gamma coupling alterations. Thus, initial alterations in hippocampal network activity arise before Aβ accumulation and may represent an early biomarker for AD.},

We have investigated one feature of hippocampal activity related to memory, the γ (30–80 Hz)-frequency rhythm. Hippocampal slices from mice overexpressing the human amyloid precursor protein (APP)SWE mutation (TAS10) were compared at 8 and 16 months of age with wild-type littermates. In slices obtained from TAS10 mice aged 8 months the γ-frequency activity evoked with bath application of 200 nm kainate was significantly (P {\textless} 0.05; n = 8 slices, five animals) impaired (area power, 5956 ± 2487 µV2) compared to slices from wild-type animals (area power, 18 256 ± 7880 µV2). At 16 months of age there was no longer a significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.05; n = 11 slices from five animals) between slices from TAS10 and wild-type control mice as the wild-type mice now exhibited a marked age-dependent reduction in γ-frequency activity (TAS10 area power, 5751 ± 1573 µV2; wild-type area power = 5379 ± 1454 µV2). Although no dense-core plaques were evident at 8 months there was detectable amyloid labelling in the TAS10 mice which might account for the deficits in γ activity observed at this age. Dense plaques were clearly evident in the TAS10, but not wild-type, mice at 16 months of age but no further reductions in γ-frequency activity were seen in the TAS10 mice. These data suggest that deficits in network function in Alzheimer's disease occur early and are not directly correlated to amyloid load.},

While in Alzheimer’s disease, abnormal hippocampal oscillations have been reported, the functional contribution of SWRs to the typically observed spatial memory impairments remains unclear. These impairments have been related to degenerative synaptic changes produced by soluble amyloid beta oligomers (Aβos) which, surprisingly, seem to spare the SWR dynamics during routine behavior. To unravel a potential effect of Aβos on SWRs in cognitively-challenged animals, we submitted vehicle- and Aβo-injected mice to spatial recognition memory testing. While capable of forming short-term recognition memory, Aβ mice exhibited faster forgetting, suggesting successful encoding but an inability to adequately stabilize and/or retrieve previously acquired information. Without prior cognitive requirements, similar properties of SWRs were observed in both groups. In contrast, when cognitively challenged, the post-encoding and -recognition peaks in SWR occurrence observed in controls were abolished in Aβ mice, indicating impaired hippocampal processing of spatial information. These results point to a crucial involvement of SWRs in spatial memory formation and identify the Aβ-induced impairment in SWRs dynamics as a disruptive mechanism responsible for the spatial memory deficits associated with Alzheimer’s disease.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly today. One of the earliest symptoms of AD is olfactory dysfunction. The present study investigated the effects of amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP) metabolites, including amyloid-β (Aβ) and AβPP C-terminal fragments (CTF), on olfactory processing in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) using the Tg2576 mouse model of human AβPP over-expression. The entorhinal cortex is an early target of AD related neuropathology, and the LEC plays an important role in fine odor discrimination and memory. Cohorts of transgenic and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice at 3, 6, and 16months of age (MO) were anesthetized and acute, single-unit electrophysiology was performed in the LEC. Results showed that Tg2576 exhibited early LEC hyperactivity at 3 and 6MO compared to WT mice in both local field potential and single-unit spontaneous activity. However, LEC single-unit odor responses and odor receptive fields showed no detectable difference compared to WT at any age. Finally, the very early emergence of olfactory system hyper-excitability corresponded not to detectable Aβ deposition in the olfactory system, but rather to high levels of intracellular AβPP-CTF and soluble Aβ in the anterior piriform cortex (aPCX), a major afferent input to the LEC, by 3MO. The present results add to the growing evidence of AβPP-related hyper-excitability, and further implicate both soluble Aβ and non-Aβ AβPP metabolites in its early emergence.},

	abstract = {The entorhinal cortex (EC) is divided into medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) anatomical areas, and layer II neurons of these two regions project to granule cells of the dentate gyrus through the medial and lateral perforant pathways (MPP and LPP), respectively. Stellate cells (SCs) represent the main neurons constituting the MPP inputs, while fan cells (FCs) represent the main LPP inputs. Here, we first characterized the excitability properties of SCs and FCs in adult wild-type (WT) mouse brain. Our data indicate that, during sustained depolarization, action potentials (APs) generated by SCs exhibit increased fast afterhyperpolarization and overshoot, making them able to fire at higher frequencies and to exhibit higher spike frequency adaptation (SFA) than FCs. Since the EC is one of the earliest brain regions affected during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, we compared SCs and FCs firing in 4-month-old WT and transgenic Tg2576 mice, a well-established AD mouse model. Tg2576-SCs displayed a slight increase in firing frequency during mild depolarization but otherwise normal excitability properties during higher stimulations. On the contrary, Tg2576-FCs exhibited a decreased firing frequency during mild and higher depolarizations, as well as an increased SFA. Our data identify the FCs as a neuronal population particularly sensitive to early pathological effects of chronic accumulation of APP-derived peptides, as it occurs in Tg2576 mice. As FCs represent the major input of sensory information to the hippocampus during memory acquisition, early alterations in their excitability profile could significantly contribute to the onset of cognitive decline in AD.},

A loss of ECIIPN–CA1PV synapses disables the excitatory and inhibitory balance in the CA1 circuit and impairs spatial learning and memory. Optogenetic activation of ECIIPN using a theta burst paradigm rescues ECIIPN–CA1PV synaptic defects and intercepts the decline in spatial learning and memory.

In contrast, mechanistic models are useful to interpret microcircuit dynamics, but are rarely quantitatively matched to experimental data due to methodological challenges. Here we present analytical methods to efficiently fit spiking circuit models to single-trial spike trains. Using derived likelihood functions, we statistically infer the mean and variance of hidden inputs, neuronal adaptation properties and connectivity for coupled integrate-and-fire neurons. Comprehensive evaluations on synthetic data, validations using ground truth in-vitro and in-vivo recordings, and comparisons with existing techniques demonstrate that parameter estimation is very accurate and efficient, even for highly subsampled networks. Our methods bridge statistical, data-driven and theoretical, model-based neurosciences at the level of spiking circuits, for the purpose of a quantitative, mechanistic interpretation of recorded neuronal population activity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we argue that a deficit in “mental frame syncing” between egocentric and allocentric spatial representations causes early manifestations of topographical disorientation in AD. Specifically, patients show impairment in translating from an allocentric hippocampal representation to an egocentric parietal one for the purpose of effective spatial orientation and navigation. We suggest that a break in “mental frame syncing”, underpinned by damage to the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex, may be a crucial cognitive marker both for early and differential diagnosis of AD. Identification of these spatial deficits could facilitate the development of early cognitive rehabilitation interventions and the possibility of identifying individuals most at risk for progression to AD during the preclinical stages.},

Methods Tests deemed sensitive to translation of spatial representations were used to evaluate 29 AD (14 YOAD, 15 LOAD) and 27 cognitively healthy controls (14 younger NC and 13 older NC).
Results: Younger NC outperformed YOAD in the tests of translation of spatial representations in spite of their equal basic visuoperceptual abilities and distance estimation. No such difference existed between LOAD and older NC.
Conclusion: The translation of egocentric-allocentric representation ability, as a principal function of RSC, does not deteriorate equally in early-stage AD patients of different onset age. That early-stage YOAD show more deviations in translation of their spatial representation ability deserves our attention because it may endanger their daily activities.},

	abstract = {Present evidence suggests that medial temporal cortices subserve allocentric representation and memory, whereas egocentric representation and memory also depends on parietal association cortices and the striatum. Virtual reality environments have a major advantage for the assessment of spatial navigation and memory formation, as computer-simulated first-person environments can simulate navigation in a large-scale space. Twenty-nine patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) were compared with 29 healthy matched controls on two virtual reality tasks affording to learn a virtual park (allocentric memory) and a virtual maze (egocentric memory). Participants further received a neuropsychological investigation and MRI volumetry at the time of the assessment. Results indicate that aMCI patients had significantly reduced size of the hippocampus bilaterally and the right-sided precuneus and inferior parietal cortex. aMCI patients were severely impaired learning the virtual park and the virtual maze. Smaller volumes of the right-sided precuneus were related to worse performance on the virtual maze. Participants with striatal lacunar lesions committed more errors than participants without such lesions on the virtual maze but not on the virtual park. aMCI patients later converting to dementia (n=15) had significantly smaller hippocampal size when compared with non-converters (n=14). However, both groups did not differ on virtual reality task performance. Our study clearly demonstrates the feasibility of virtual reality technology to study spatial memory deficits of persons with aMCI. Future studies should try to design spatial virtual reality tasks being specific enough to predict conversion from MCI to dementia and conversion from normal to MCI.},

Studies in non-human species suggest that alteration in hippocampal and other neural circuitry may underlie behavioral deficits associated with aging but little is known about the neural mechanisms of human age-related decline in spatial navigation. The purpose of the present study was to examine age differences in functional brain activation during virtual environment navigation. Voxel-based analysis of activation patterns in young subjects identified activation in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, retrosplenial cortex, right and left lateral parietal cortex, medial parietal lobe and cerebellum. In comparison to younger subjects, elderly participants showed reduced activation in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, medial parietal lobe and retrosplenial cortex. Relative to younger participants elderly subjects showed increased activation in anterior cingulate gyrus and medial frontal lobe. These results provide evidence of age specific neural networks supporting spatial navigation and identify a putative neural substrate for age-related differences in spatial memory and navigational skill.},

	abstract = {Navigation processes mediated selectively by the entorhinal cortex (EC) may be impaired in individuals with suspected preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the clinical utility of navigation tests to detect such impairments remains to be established. In a sample of 64 individuals (32 e3e3 and 32 e3e4), we tested whether an existing paradigm, the Virtual Supermarket Test (VST), can reliably detect the presence or absence of the APOE e4 allele which accelerates amyloid plaque deposition in the brain. The present study assessed four major navigational processes that are subserved by functionally specialised cell groups located in AD vulnerable regions including the EC and examined the relationship between navigation process and regional functional connectivity (FC) given FC is a marker early ADrelated tau seeding. While heading direction and spatial memory were unaffected by at-risk AD, clear altered navigational strategies following path integration were found on the VST in the e3e4 group. The APOE-sensitive VST measure correctly classified 77\% of the APOE cohort. Including resting-state FC between the EC and the posterior cingulate cortex, a correlate of the path integration deficit in the APOE e4 group, the classification model increased the accuracy to 85\%. Our findings show that at-genetic-risk AD selectively impairs path integration and biases self-reported spatial locations away from the centre and towards the boundary of a virtual environment. Importantly, this impairment is associated with reduced FC between the EC and the posterior cingulate cortex, which in turn informs the neurobiological mechanisms of at-genetic-risk of AD.},

	abstract = {Previous group studies using positron emission tomography to assess resting cerebral glucose metabolism in very early Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment have identified the posterior cingulate and adjacent cingulo-parietal cortex as the first isocortical area to develop hypometabolism. We studied the profile of resting cerebral glucose metabolism in individuals with mild cognitive impairment to assess whether more specific and stereotyped regional hypometabolism would be evident across subjects. The study found that the most consistently hypometabolic region between individual subjects was a subregion of the posterior cingulate, the retrosplenial cortex (BA 29/30). This result is discussed in the context of regional connectivity, focal lesion evidence and functional activation studies of episodic memory paradigms in both normal and Alzheimer's disease groups. We propose that the retrosplenial cortex may represent a key junction between prefrontal areas involved in implementing retrieval strategies for episodic memory and hippocampal-based mnemonic processing; we therefore interpret the retrosplenial hypometabolism as a probable contributor to the memory impairment seen in mild cognitive impairment by disconnecting these two anatomical networks.},

	abstract = {Most neuronal interactions in the cortex occur within local circuits. Because principal cells and GABAergic interneurons contribute differently to cortical operations, their experimental identification and separation is of utmost important. We used 64-site two-dimensional silicon probes for high-density recording of local neurons in layer 5 of the somatosensory and prefrontal cortices of the rat. Multiple-site monitoring of units allowed for the determination of their two-dimensional spatial position in the brain. Of the approximately 60,000 cell pairs recorded, 0.2\% showed robust short-term interactions. Units with significant, short-latency ({\textless}3 ms) peaks following their action potentials in their cross-correlograms were characterized as putative excitatory (pyramidal) cells. Units with significant suppression of spiking of their partners were regarded as putative GABAergic interneurons. A portion of the putative interneurons was reciprocally connected with pyramidal cells. Neurons physiologically identified as inhibitory and excitatory cells were used as templates for classification of all recorded neurons. Of the several parameters tested, the duration of the unfiltered (1 Hz to 5 kHz) spike provided the most reliable clustering of the population. High-density parallel recordings of neuronal activity, determination of their physical location and their classification into pyramidal and interneuron classes provide the necessary tools for local circuit analysis.},

Laminar analysis of neocortical gamma bursts revealed multiple gamma oscillators of varying frequency and location, which were spatially confined and synchronized local groups of neurons. A significant fraction of putative pyramidal cells and interneurons as well as localized gamma oscillations in all recorded neocortical areas were phase biased by the hippocampal theta rhythm.

(1997) Hippocampus 7:624–642, suggested that hippocampal place cell firing is controlled by distal cues and proximal floor inserts in a flexible and hierarchical fashion. Control exerted by the combined set of cues prevailed over control by distal cues, which itself prevailed over control by proximal cues. Here, we examined the generality of this hierarchy in the use of cues. Place cells were recorded as rats performed a pellet chasing task on a platform containing three proximal objects, surrounded by a curtain where three visual stimuli were hung. A double rotation of distal and proximal cue sets producing a 180° mismatch revealed noncoherent responses of place cells. Most fields were controlled by the configuration of proximal and distal cues (i.e., remapped). Less often, fields were controlled by specific cues with a majority being controlled by proximal cues, thus suggesting that response hierarchy is modulated by the environment. We finally examined the effect of removing one set of cues after the double rotation session. Half of the fields were controlled by the remaining cues while the other half remapped, thus suggesting a competition between pattern completion and pattern separation processes. Furthermore, cells that were controlled by the remaining cues were mainly those that had remapped in the double rotation session. Our results are compatible with the idea that the flexibility of the place cell system results from an interaction between the sensory properties of individual cell and the attractor networks properties of the whole place cell population. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

For example, agricultural workers, military personnel, industrial manufacturers, veterinarians, horticulturists, aircraft maintenance personnel, and pilots are all potentially at risk of occupational exposure to organophosphates (OPs), which are associated with increased risk of AD. We report here that occupational-like exposure of young animals to the OP chlorpyrifos (CPF) accelerates AD-like cognitive deficits and severe neurodegeneration in male, but not female, TgF344-AD rats, a genetic model of AD. CPF exposure also causes chronic dysregulation of brain microglial cells, while amyloid and tau pathology are not affected. Thus, microglial dysregulation after environmental toxin exposure may represent a second hit that advances the disease. Future therapies to preserve or restore normal microglia might help prevent AD in genetically vulnerable individuals exposed to CPF or other disease-accelerating environmental agents.},

	title = {Part {I}. {A} phase-plane analysis of the relationship between location and velocity},
	abstract = {Rat exploratory behavior consists of regular excursions into the environment from a preferred place termed a home base. A phase plane representation of excursions reveals a geometrical pattern that changes during exploration in both shape and size. We ®rst show that with time and repeated exposures to the same large environment there is a gradual increase in the length of excursions; each rat has its own characteristic length of excursions; but all rats share a similar rate of excursion growth. As in our experimental setup the rats perform increasingly longer paths from one location, while locomoting back and forth along the walls of the arena, exposure is more extensive at the proximal part of the route, and less at the distal part. We consequently show that the rat's velocity pattern changes concurrently with the increase in excursion length, and in correlation with the level of exposure (familiarity) to places. The primitive velocity pattern consists of slow progression while moving away from base and fast progression while returning to it. During exposure the asymmetry in velocity is inverted. The inversion spreads across successive excursions from the home base outwards. The rate of spread of this inversion is higher than the rate of increase in excursion length, and is similar across rats. Because it spreads more rapidly than the increase in excursion length, the global shape of the excursion trajectory changes. The dynamics of excursion shape share similar properties with the dynamics of excursion length. Both might re¯ect the same intrinsic constraints on the amount of novelty that a rat can handle per excursion.},

Here the activity of control rats and rats with fimbria-fornix lesions is documented in tests of overnight activity. Details of activity are then characterized from video recordings of behavior in an open field. Rats with fimbria-fornix lesions make significantly more stops of shorter duration and thus more individual trips than control rats but they do not differ in the distance traveled on individual trips or in travel speed. It is suggested that the main difference between fimbria-fornix rats and control rats is that when fimbria-fornix rats stop they remain “still” for shorter durations than do control rats. This finding is discussed in relation to a theory of locomotor/exploratory behavior, and in relation to its implications with respect to the performance of fimbria-fornix rats in studies of learning and memory. 01994 Wiley-Liss,Inc.},

	abstract = {Rat exploration is an organized series of trips. Each exploratory trip involves an outward tour from the refuge followed by a return to the refuge. A tour consists of a sequence of progressions with variable direction and speed concatenated by stops, whereas the return consists of a single direct progression. We have argued that processing self-movement information generated on the tour allows a rat to plot the return to the refuge. This claim has been supported by observing consistent differences between tour and return segments independent of ambient cue availability; however, this distinction was based on differences in movement characteristics derived from multiple progressions and stops on the tour and the single progression on the return. The present study examines movement characteristics of the tour and return progressions under novel-dark and light conditions. Three novel characteristics of progressions were identiﬁed: (1) linear speeds and path curvature of exploratory trips are negatively correlated, (2) tour progression maximum linear speed and temporal pacing varies as a function of travel distance, and (3) return progression movement characteristics are qualitatively different from tour progressions of comparable length. These observations support a role for dead reckoning in organizing exploratory behavior.},

We report here that occupational-like exposure of young animals to the OP chlorpyrifos (CPF) accelerates AD-like cognitive deficits and severe neurodegeneration in male, but not female, TgF344-AD rats, a genetic model of AD. CPF exposure also causes chronic dysregulation of brain microglial cells, while amyloid and tau pathology are not affected. Thus, microglial dysregulation after environmental toxin exposure may represent a second hit that advances the disease. Future therapies to preserve or restore normal microglia might help prevent AD in genetically vulnerable individuals exposed to CPF or other disease-accelerating environmental agents.},

	abstract = {Circular data are common in biological studies. The most fundamental question that can be asked of a sample of circular data is whether it suggests that the underlying population is uniformly distributed around the circle, or whether it is concentrated around at least one preferred direction (e.g. a migratory goal or activity phase). We compared the statistical power of five commonly used tests (the Rayleigh test, the V-test, Watson’s test, Kuiper’s test and Rao’s spacing test) across a range of different unimodal scenarios. The V-test showed higher power for symmetrical distributions, Rao’s spacing performed worst for all explored unimodal distributions tested and the remaining three tests showed very similar performance. However, the V-test only applies if the hypothesis is restricted to one (pre-specified) direction of interest. In all other unimodal cases, we recommend using the Rayleigh test. Much less explored is the multimodal case with data concentrated around several directions. We performed power simulations for a variety of multimodal situations, testing the performance of the widely used Rayleigh, Rao’s, Watson, and Kuiper’s tests as well as the more recent Bogdan and Hermans-Rasson tests. Our analyses of alternative statistical methods show that the commonly used tests lack statistical power in many of multimodal cases. Transformation of the raw data (e.g. doubling the angles) can overcome some of the issues, but only in the case of perfect f-fold symmetry. However, the Hermans-Rasson method, which is not yet implemented in any software package, outcompetes the alternative tests (often by substantial margins) in most of the multimodal situations explored. We recommend the wider uptake of the powerful but hitherto neglected Hermans-Rasson method. In summary, we provide guidance for biologists helping them to make decisions when testing circular data for single or multiple departures from uniformity.},

Growing evidence suggests spatial orientation is a reliable cognitive marker able to differentiate these two clinical syndromes.
Objective: Assess the integrity of egocentric and allocentric heading orientation and memory in bvFTD and AD, and their clinical implications.
Method: A cohort of 22 patients with dementia (11 bvFTD; 11 AD) and 14 healthy controls were assessed on the virtual supermarket task of spatial orientation and a battery of standardized neuropsychological measures of visual and verbal memory performance.
Results: Judgements of egocentric and allocentric heading direction were differentially impaired in bvFTD and AD, with AD performing signiﬁcantly worse on egocentric heading judgements than bvFTD. Both patient cohorts, however, showed similar degree of impaired allocentric spatial representation, and associated hippocampal pathology.
Conclusions: The ﬁndings suggest egocentric heading judgements offer a more sensitive discriminant of bvFTD and AD than allocentric map-based measures of spatial memory.},

	abstract = {Our thoughts and sensations are examples of cognitive processes that emerge from the collective activity of billions of neurons in the brain. Thalamocortical circuits form the canonical building-blocks of the brain networks supporting the most complex cognitive functions. How these neurons communicate and interact has been the focus of extensive research in “classical” sensory systems. Similar to visual, auditory or somatosensory thalamic pathways, one primary nucleus in the anterior (limbic) thalamus - the antero-dorsal nucleus - conveys a low-level input, the head-direction (HD) signal, to the cortex. Its activity is controlled in large part by the vestibular system and is relayed by a serially connected group of subcortical nuclei to the thalamus. HD cells serve as the brain’s internal ‘compass’ and each of them is tuned to the specific direction the animal is facing. Recently, recordings of HD neuronal populations in the antero-dorsal nucleus and its main cortical target, the post-subiculum, have revealed that neuronal activity in the thalamocortical HD network are largely invariant to brain states at three levels: static (preserved functional organization), temporal (same drifting speed during exploration and Rapid Eye Movement sleep) and inter-area interaction (from thalamus to cortex). These observations suggest that HD neurons are certainly more driven by intrinsic wiring and dynamics than by sensory inputs and that the information flows bottom-up, even during sleep. Altogether, thalamic HD cells convey a highly reliable, near-noiseless signal that broadly influences the emergence of spatial maps in the cortex and may play a key role in sleep-dependent memory processes.},

	abstract = {Episodic memory is defined as the ability to recall events in a spatiotemporal context. Formation of such memories is critically dependent on the hippocampal formation and its inputs from the entorhinal cortex. To be able to support the formation of episodic memories, entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation should contain a neuronal code that follows several requirements. First, the code should include information about position of the agent (“where”), sequence of events (“when”), and the content of the experience itself (“what”). Second, the code should arise instantly thereby being able to support memory formation of one-shot experiences. For successful encoding and to avoid interference between memories during recall, variations in location, time, or in content of experience should result in unique ensemble activity. Finally, the code should capture several different resolutions of experience so that the necessary details relevant for future memory-based predictions will be stored. We review how neuronal codes in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus follow these requirements and argue that during formation of episodic memories entorhinal cortex provides hippocampus with instant information about ongoing experience. Such information originates from (a) spatially modulated neurons in medial entorhinal cortex, including grid cells, which provide a stable and universal positional metric of the environment; (b) a continuously varying signal in lateral entorhinal cortex providing a code for the temporal progression of events; and (c) entorhinal neurons coding the content of experiences exemplified by object-coding and odor-selective neurons. During formation of episodic memories, information from these systems are thought to be encoded as unique sequential ensemble activity in hippocampus, thereby encoding associations between the content of an event and its spatial and temporal contexts. Upon exposure to parts of the encoded stimuli, activity in these ensembles can be reinstated, leading to reactivation of the encoded activity pattern and memory recollection.},

	abstract = {This study refines the characterization of the rat parietal cortical domain in terms of cyto- and chemoarchitecture as well as thalamic connectivity. We recognize three subdivisions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which are architectonically distinct from the neighboring somatosensory and visual cortices. Furthermore, we show that the different parietal areas are differently connected with thalamic nuclei. The medial portion of PPC (mPPC) is connected primarily with the medial portion of the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), whereas the lateral portion (lPPC) connects with the posterior complex (Po). The more caudolateral part of PPC (PtP) also projects to Po but can be distinguished from lPPC based on architectonic criteria. The primary somatic and visual cortices, neighboring PPC, are preferentially connected with the primary ventral posterior and dorsolateral geniculate nuclei, respectively, and less with the associational Po and LP. Particularly the border between the secondary visual cortex and the PPC has been a matter of controversy, but here we show that, although PPC subareas are connected with Po and medial LP, the medial and lateral secondary visual cortices are connected with lateral LP and a portion of medial LP different from that connected with PPC. The resulting delineations and specifications of connectivity with thalamic nuclei together with upcoming studies of cortical connectivity will facilitate detailed studies on the role of the subdivisions of PPC in the rat as diverse, higher order associative cortical areas, comparable to those described in the primate.for J.

	abstract = {Despite more than a century of research, the aetiology of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear and finding disease modifying treatments for AD presents one of the biggest medical challenges of our time. AD pathology is characterized by deposits of aggregated amyloid beta (Aβ) in amyloid plaques and aggregated tau in neurofibrillary tangles. These aggregates begin in distinct brain regions and spread throughout the brain in stereotypical patterns. Neurodegeneration, comprising loss of synapses and neurons, occurs in brain regions with high tangle pathology, and an inflammatory response of glial cells appears in brain regions with pathological aggregates. Inheriting an apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) allele strongly increases the risk of developing AD for reasons that are not yet entirely clear. Substantial amounts of evidence support a role for APOE in modulating the aggregation and clearance of Aβ, and data have been accumulating recently implicating APOE4 in exacerbating neurodegeneration, tau pathology and inflammation. We hypothesize that APOE4 influences all the pathological hallmarks of AD and may sit at the interface between neurodegeneration, inflammation and the spread of pathologies through the brain. Here, we conducted a systematic search of the literature and review evidence supporting a role for APOE4 in neurodegeneration and inflammation. While there is no direct evidence yet for APOE4 influencing the spread of pathology, we postulate that this may be found in future based on the literature reviewed here. In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of understanding the role of APOE in multiple important pathological mechanisms in AD.},

	abstract = {It is well known that uncontrolled immune response in the brain contributes to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and more particularly Alzheimer's disease. Recent investigations have documented the prion-like features of tau protein and the involvement of microglial changes upon tau pathology. While it is still unclear what sequence of events is causal, it is likely that tau seeding potential and microglial contribution to tau propagation act together, and are essential for the development and progression of degenerative changes. Based on available evidence, targeting tau seeds and controlling some signaling pathways in a complex inflammation process could represent a possible new therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Recent findings propose novel diagnostic assays and markers that may be used together with standard methods to complete and improve the diagnosis and classification of these diseases. In conclusion, a novel perspective on microglia-tau relations reveals new issues to investigate and imposes different approaches for developing therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {Chronic neuroinflammation, which is primarily mediated by microglia, plays an essential role in aging and neurodegeneration. It is still unclear whether this microglia-induced neuroinflammation occurs globally or is confined to distinct brain regions. In this study, we investigated microglia activity in various brain regions upon healthy aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related pathology in both human and mouse samples. In purified microglia isolated from the aging mouse brain, we found a profound gene expression pattern related to pro-inflammatory processes, phagocytosis, and lipid homeostasis. Particularly in white matter microglia of 24-month-old mice, abundant expression of phagocytic markers including Mac-2, Axl, CD16/32, Dectin1, Cd11c, and Cd36 was detected. In white matter of human brain the first signs of inflammatory activity were already detected during middle age. Quantification of microglial proteins, such as CD68 (commonly associated with phagocytosis) and HLA-DR (associated with antigen presentation), in postmortem human white matter brain tissue showed an age-dependent increase in immunoreactivity already in middle-aged people (53.2 ± 2.0 yr), which was also detectable by non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using [11C]-(R)-PK11195, a ligand that binds to activated microglia. Increased microglia activity was also prominently present in the white matter of human early-onset postmortem AD (EOAD) brains. Interestingly, microglia activity in the white matter of late-onset AD (LOAD) CNS was similar to that of the aged clinically-silent AD cases. These data indicate that microglia-induced neuroinflammation is predominant in the white matter of aging mice and humans as well as in EOAD brains. This white matter inflammation may contribute to the progression of neurodegeneration, and have prognostic value for detecting the onset and progression of aging and neurodegeneration.},

	abstract = {Objective
The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene increases risk for cognitive decline in normal and pathologic aging. However, precisely how APOE ε4 exerts its negative impact on cognition is poorly understood. The present study aimed to determine whether APOE genotype (ε4+ vs. ε4-) modifies the interaction of medial temporal lobe (MTL) resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain structure (cortical thickness [CT], volume [Vo]) on verbal memory performance.
Methods
Multiple linear regression models were employed to investigate relationships between APOE genotype, arterial spin labeling MRI-measured CBF and FreeSurfer-based CT and Vo in four MTL regions of interest (left and right entorhinal cortex and hippocampus), and verbal memory performance among a sample of 117 cognitively normal older adults (41 ε4+, 76 ε4-) between the ages of 64 and 89 (mean age ​= ​73).
Results
Results indicated that APOE genotype modified the interaction of CBF and CT on memory in the left entorhinal cortex, such that the relationship between entorhinal CBF and memory was negative (lower CBF was associated with better memory) in non-carriers with higher entorhinal CT, positive (higher CBF was associated with better memory) in non-carriers with lower entorhinal CT, and negative (higher CBF was associated with worse memory) in ε4 carriers with lower entorhinal CT.
Conclusions
Findings suggest that older adult APOE ε4 carriers may experience vascular dysregulation and concomitant morphological alterations in the MTL that interact to negatively affect memory even in the absence overt clinical symptoms, providing potential insight into the mechanistic link between APOE ε4 and detriments in cognition. Moreover, findings suggest a distinct multimodal neural signature in ε4 carriers (higher CBF and lower CT in the entorhinal cortex) that could aid in the identification of candidates for future clinical trials aimed at preventing or slowing cognitive decline. Differential findings with respect to ε4 carriers and non-carriers are discussed in the context of neurovascular compensation.},

	abstract = {Previous group studies using positron emission tomography to assess resting cerebral glucose metabolism in very early Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment have identified the posterior cingulate and adjacent cingulo-parietal cortex as the first isocortical area to develop hypometabolism. We studied the profile of resting cerebral glucose metabolism in individuals with mild cognitive impairment to assess whether more specific and stereotyped regional hypometabolism would be evident across subjects. The study found that the most consistently hypometabolic region between individual subjects was a subregion of the posterior cingulate, the retrosplenial cortex (BA 29/30). This result is discussed in the context of regional connectivity, focal lesion evidence and functional activation studies of episodic memory paradigms in both normal and Alzheimer's disease groups. We propose that the retrosplenial cortex may represent a key junction between prefrontal areas involved in implementing retrieval strategies for episodic memory and hippocampal-based mnemonic processing; we therefore interpret the retrosplenial hypometabolism as a probable contributor to the memory impairment seen in mild cognitive impairment by disconnecting these two anatomical networks.},

We then studied a cohort with mild cognitive impairment in whom amnesia was the only cognitive abnormality and found comparable hypometabolism through the same network. The AD and mild cognitive impairment groups were differentiated, however, by changes outside this network, the former showing significant hypometabolism in amygdala and temporoparietal and frontal association cortex, whereas the latter did not.

In addition, correlational approaches have shown a correspondence between head direction cells and spatial behavior in some tasks, but not others. These mixed effects may be explained in part by a new view of the head direction cell system arising from recent demonstrations of at least two types of head direction cells: ‘traditional’ cells, and a second class of ‘sensory’ cells driven by polarising features of an environment.

Animals with selective dorsal, ventral or complete hippocampal lesions were tested in a water maze, in which the target platform was moved from trial to trial, but always within a defined area, instead of being at a fixed location. Hence, an animal that searched at exactly the point where the platform had been found on a previous trial would be disadvantaged, in comparison with an animal that searched in the right general area. This might favor animals capable of less precise navigation over those with very precise navigational abilities. In subsequent phases of the experiment, we additionally assessed, for comparison, performance with a fixed platform location, reversal learning in the water-maze, and performance on an elevated T-maze. Our results revealed no sign of any qualitative difference between the effects of the selective sub-total lesions when the water maze hidden platform location was varied within the defined area, and the effects in subsequent more conventionally used tests. Ventral hippocampal damage never led to a performance deficit. Dorsal hippocampal damage led to significantly poorer performance in only some test phases, and never led to any sign of improved performance.},

The lesions were made by infusing small volumes of the neurotoxin at a total of 26 (hippocampus) or 20 (subiculum) sites intended to achieve complete target cell loss but minimal extratarget damage. The regional extent and axon-sparing nature of these lesions was evaluated using both cresyl violet and Fink – Heimer stained sections. The behavioural findings indicated that both the hippocampus and subiculum lesions caused impairment to the initial postoperative acquisition of place navigation but did not prevent eventual learning to levels of performance almost as effective as those of controls. However, overtraining of the hippocampus + subiculum lesioned rats did not result in significant place learning. Qualitative observations of the paths taken to find a hidden escape platform indicated that different strategies were deployed by hippocampal and subiculum lesioned groups. Subsequent training on a delayed matching to place task revealed a deficit in all lesioned groups across a range of sample choice intervals, but the subiculum lesioned group was less impaired than the group with the hippocampal lesion. Finally, unoperated control rats given both the initial training and overtraining were later given either a hippocampal lesion or sham surgery. The hippocampal lesioned rats were impaired during a subsequent retention/relearning phase. Together, these findings suggest that total hippocampal cell loss may cause a dual deficit: a slower rate of place learning and a separate navigational impairment. The prospect of unravelling dissociable components of allocentric spatial learning is discussed.},

	abstract = {Age-related decline in spatial navigation is well-known and the extant literature emphasizes the important contributions of a hippocampus-dependent spatial navigation system in mediating this decline. However, navigation is a multifaceted cognitive domain and some aspects of age-related navigational decline may be mediated by extrahippocampal brain regions and/or systems. The current review presents an overview of some key cognitive domains that contribute to the age-related changes in spatial navigation ability, and elucidates such domains in the context of an increased engagement of navigationally relevant extrahippocampal brain regions with advancing age. Specifically, this review focuses on age-related declines in three main areas: (i) allocentric strategy use and switching between egocentric and allocentric strategies, (ii) associative learning of landmarks/locations and heading directions, and (iii) executive functioning and attention. Thus far, there is accumulating neuroimaging evidence supporting the functional relevance of the striatum for egocentric/response strategy use in older adults, and of the prefrontal cortex for mediating executive functions that contribute to successful navigational performance. Notably, the functional role of the prefrontal cortex was particularly emphasized via the proposed relevance of the fronto-locus coeruleus noradrenergic system for strategy switching and of the fronto-hippocampal circuit for landmark-direction associative learning. In view of these putative prefrontal contributions to navigation-related functions, we recommend future spatial navigation studies to adopt a systems-oriented approach that investigates age-related alterations in the interaction between the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and extrahippocampal regions, as well as an individual differences approach that clarifies the differential engagement of prefrontal executive processes among older adults.},

Even though its reliance on hippocampal networks has long been established, the precise computations performed by different hippocampal subﬁelds during spatial learning are still not clear. To study the evolution of electrophysiological activity in the CA1–dentate gyrus axis of the dorsal hippocampus over an iterative spatial learning paradigm, we recorded local ﬁeld potentials in behaving mice using a newly designed appetitive version of the Barnes maze. We ﬁrst showed that theta and gamma oscillations as well as theta–gamma coupling are differentially modulated in particular hippocampal subﬁelds during the task. In addition, we show that dentate gyrus networks, but not CA1 networks, exhibit a transient learning-dependent increase in theta–gamma coupling speciﬁcally at the vicinity of the target area in the maze. In contrast to previous immediate early-gene studies, our results point to a long-lasting involvement of dentate networks in navigational memory in the Barnes maze. Based on these ﬁndings, we propose that theta–gamma coupling might represent a mechanism by which hippocampal areas compute relevant information.},

Recent insights imply ways in which theta–gamma coupling may facilitate transfer of information throughout the entorhinal–hippocampal network. Activating gamma-modulated cell assemblies at a particular theta phase may allow the network to produce a more powerful output by ensuring that distributed cells fire closely in time.

Theta sequences are thought to be organized by co-occurring gamma rhythms (∼25–100 Hz). However, how sequences of locations are represented during distinct slow (∼25–55 Hz) and fast (∼60–100 Hz) gamma subtypes remains poorly understood. We found that slow gamma-associated theta sequences activated on a compressed timescale and represented relatively long paths extending ahead of the current location. Fast gamma-associated theta sequences more closely followed an animal’s actual location in real time. When slow gamma occurred, sequences of locations were represented across successive slow gamma phases. Conversely, fast gamma phase coding of spatial sequences was not observed. These findings suggest that slow gamma promotes activation of temporally compressed representations of upcoming trajectories, whereas fast gamma supports coding of ongoing trajectories in real time.

We show here that layer 6 (L6) principal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) receive a diffuse, vestibular-mediated synaptic input that signals the angular velocity of horizontal rotation. Behavioral and theoretical experiments indicate that these inputs, distributed over a network of 100 L6 neurons, provide both a reliable estimate and, therefore, physiological separation of head-velocity signals. During head rotation in the presence of visual stimuli, L6 neurons exhibit postsynaptic responses that approximate the arithmetic sum of the vestibular and visual-motion response. Functional input mapping reveals that these internal motion signals arrive into L6 via a direct projection from the retrosplenial cortex. We therefore propose that visual-motion processing in V1 L6 is multisensory and contextually dependent on the motion status of the animal’s head.},

	title = {Impaired path integration correlates with selective disruption of grid cells in an amyloid beta mouse model of preclinical {Alzheimer}’s disease},
	abstract = {Despite being considered a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the presence of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques in the brain weakly correlates with cognition in patients. In fact, plaques are present in cognitively normal adults, suggesting that the pathophysiology of AD takes place during the early stages of Aβ pathology. Indeed, general soluble Aβ deposition in the brain occurs decades prior to the onset of clinical AD and is linked to poorer cognitive performance. This highlights the importance of establishing reliable biomarkers of early Aβ pathology, and by extension, preclinical AD, to identify healthy individuals at risk. In line with this goal, it’s been shown that healthy individuals at genetic risk for AD have path integration (PI) deficits (Kunz et al., 2015). Concurrently, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveals that a grid-like signal is impaired in these individuals, suggesting that the PI deficits result from a disrupted grid cell network in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Notably, the onset of these impairments match time points during which soluble Aβ deposition increases in the brain (Lesné et al., 2013). However, it remains unclear if PI and grid cell fidelity are truly specific to early Aβ processes or a different phenomenon altogether. To establish a direct link between grid cells and PI deficits in the early stages of Aβ deposition, we carried out PI behavioral testing and in-vivo electrophysiological recordings in the MEC of the transgenic J20 mouse model of Aβ pathology. We demonstrate an aged-related deficit in the spatial tuning of grid cells. Conversely, the firing representations of all other spatially-tuned cells in the MEC, along with place cells in region CA1 of the hippocampus, were undisrupted. On a behavioral level, J20 mice exhibited worsened PI across age in a food-foraging task in darkness, but their allocentric navigation remained intact. These results are similar to existing PI data in individuals at genetic risk for AD, indicating homogeny between rodent and human spatial navigation. Taken together, our data show that PI performance and grid cell fidelity have predictive utility in determining those at risk of AD and pinpoint the MEC as a target to direct preclinical treatments.},

Here, by simultaneously recording ensembles of neurons in the anterior thalamus and local field potentials in the CA1 area of the hippocampus, we show that the head-direction (HD) cells of the anterodorsal nucleus are set in stable states immediately before SWRs. This response contrasts with other thalamic cells that exhibit diverse couplings to the hippocampus related to their intrinsic dynamics but independent of their anatomical location.

	abstract = {In the awake brain, information about the external world reaches the hippocampus via the entorhinal cortex, whereas during sleep the direction of information flow is reversed: population bursts initiated in the hippocampus invade the neocortex. We suggest that neocortico-hippocampal transfer of information and the modification process in neocortical circuitries by the hippocampal output take place in a temporally discontinuous manner associated with the wake-sleep cycle. Loading the hippocampus with neocortical information may happen fast during the aroused state of the hippocampus associated with theta/gamma oscillations. On the other hand, transfer of the stored representations to neocortical areas is carried by discrete quanta of co-operative neuronal bursts (called sharp wave bursts) initiated in the hippocampus during slow wave sleep. The spatio-temporal participation of principal cells in sharp waves is determined by experience-induced changes in the CA3 recurrent collateral matrix. The co-operative, converging pre-synaptic activity can induce localized fast spikes and associated calcium influx in the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, a necessary condition for the induction of synaptic plasticity. In addition, the subcortical effects of hippocampal sharp wave bursts may be critical in the release of various hormones which, in turn, may affect synaptic plasticity. These observations suggest that sleep patterns in the limbic system are essential for the preservation of experience-induced synaptic modifications.},

	abstract = {We have previously used fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) autoradiography to detect the pattern of metabolic declines in two different transgenic mouse models of fibrillar beta-amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the PDAPP mouse, which overexpresses a mutant form of human APP, and the PSAPP mouse, which overexpresses mutant forms of the human APP and PS1 genes. In this study, we used the same approach to study a triple-transgenic (3xTG) model of AD, which overexpresses human APP, PS1 and tau mutations, and progressively develops amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and synaptic dysfunction. Densitometric measurements from 55 brain regions were characterized and compared in 2, 12, and 18month-old 3xTG and wildtype control mice (n=12/group). By 18months of age, the 3xTG mice had significant reductions in FDG uptake in every measured brain region, including cortical and subcortical gray matter, cerebellar and brainstem regions. However, regional differences in normalized FDG uptake were apparent in the 2- and 12-month-old 3xTG mice, in a brain network pattern reminiscent of our previous analyses in the other mouse models. This prominently included the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, as in each previously-analyzed model. Overall, our analyses highlight consistencies in brain glucose uptake abnormalities across multiple mouse models of amyloid-associated pathophysiology. These mouse brain regional changes are homologous to alterations seen in PET scans from human AD patients and could thus be useful biomarkers for early testing of novel interventions.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients exhibit various cognitive dysfunctions, including impairment of orientation for time (OT). The brain regions underlying OT impairment remain to be elucidated. A previous single-photon emission computed tomography study has indicated hypoperfusion of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in relation to deterioration of OT. In this study, we investigated whole brain functional connectivity changes of PCC using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based functional connectivity with PCC was analyzed in OT-poor or OT-good AD patients, classified according to the mean OT scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination subscale. The connectivities of dorsal frontal lobe, and lateral parietal and lateral temporal lobes with PCC in the right hemisphere were reduced in the OT-poor AD group compared with the OT-good AD group. A subtraction connectivity map of OT score differences (OT-good minus OT-poor) revealed the right middle temporal gyrus near the temporo-parietal junction as a significantly connected region with PCC. These results suggest that the right posterior part of the middle temporal gyrus may play an important role in OT in conjunction with PCC, and that disconnection between PCC and the right ventral attention network may cause OT disturbance in AD patients.},

However, the anatomical area of the presubiculum, is characterised by the presence of a single large evenly distributed ‘lake-like’ Aβ deposit with minimal tau deposition or accumulation of inflammatory markers. Post-mortem brain samples from sporadic AD (SAD) and familial AD (FAD) and two hereditary cerebral amyloid diseases, familial British dementia (FBD) and familial Danish dementia (FDD) were used to compare the morphology of the extracellular proteins deposited in the presubiculum compared to the entorhinal cortex. The level of tau pathology and the extent of microglial activation were quantitated in the two brain regions in SAD and FAD. Frozen tissue was used to investigate the Aβ species and proteomic differences between the two regions. Consistent with our previous investigations of FBD and FDD cases we were able to establish that the ‘lake-like’ pre-amyloid deposits of the presubiculum were not a unique feature of AD but they also found two non-Aβ amyloidosis. Comparing the presubiculum to the entorhinal cortex the number of neurofibrillary tangles and tau load were significantly reduced; there was a reduction in microglial activation; there were differences in the Aβ profiles and the investigation of the whole proteome showed significant changes in different protein pathways. In summary, understanding why the presubiculum has a different morphological appearance, biochemical and proteomic makeup compared to surrounding brain regions severely affected by neurodegeneration could lead us to understanding protective mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases.},

We analyzed longitudinal structural neuroimaging data of 1350 individuals, 350 healthy controls (HC), 650 MCI and 350 AD, using FreeSurfer v6.0. The linear regression models corrected for total hippocampal volume revealed that subicular fields are the most predictive measures of AD diagnosis. Hippocampal fissure volume was significantly associated with conversion from MCI to AD. Our findings suggest that subicular hippocampal fields are most predictive of AD diagnosis, which has clinical implications for early detection. Specifically, subicular and hippocampal fissure volume measures may be used to select MCI participants who are most likely to convert in AD in clinical trials.},

The polymorphic binding site on multimeric Aβ for current radioligands, however, is little understood. In this study, we investigated the binding of several radioligands including 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (11C-PiB), 3H-AZD2184, and two recently developed compounds, 125I-DRM106 and 125I-DRK092, with unique presubicular Aβ deposits lacking interaction with the commonly used amyloid dyes FSB. 11C-PiB, 3H-AZD2184, and 125I-DRK092 showed overt binding to presubicular Aβ deposits, while 125I-DRM106 barely bound to these aggregates despite its strong binding in the hippocampal CA1 sector. Unlike neuritic plaques in the CA1, Aβ lesions in the presubiculum were not accompanied by inflammatory gliosis enriched with 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). Thus, there are at least two different components in Aβ aggregates providing distinct binding sites for the current amyloid radioligands, and one of these binding components is distinctly present in the presubicular Aβ deposits. Amyloid radioligands lacking affinity for this component, such as 125I-DRM106, may selectively capture Aβ deposits tightly associated with TSPO neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration as exemplified by CA1 neuritic plaques. Hence, comparative autoradiographic assessments of radioligand binding in CA1 and presubiculum could serve for the development of an amyloid PET imaging agent visualizing neurotoxicity-related Aβ pathologies. Non-invasive determination of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) serves for the early diagnosis and clarification of pathogenetic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that there are at least two different amyloid components in hippocampal CA1 and presubiculum providing distinct binding sites for the current amyloid radioligands. Comparative analysis for radioligand binding in these two regions could serve for developing novel imaging agents selectively visualizing neurotoxicity-related Aβ pathologies.},

	abstract = {The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a component of a major cortico-hippocampal circuit that is involved in relational learning, yet the specific contribution of PPC to hippocampal-dependent learning is unresolved. To address this, two experiments were carried out to test the effects of PPC damage on tasks that involve forming associations between multiple sensory stimuli. In Experiment 1, sham or electrolytic lesions of the PPC were made before rats were tested on a three-phase sensory preconditioning task. During the first phase, half of the training trials consisted of pairings of an auditory stimulus followed by a light. During the other trials, a second auditory stimulus was presented alone. In the next phase of training, the same light was paired with food, but no auditory stimuli were presented. During the final phase of the procedure both auditory stimuli were presented in the absence of reinforcement during a single test session. As is typically observed during the test session, control rats exhibited greater conditioned responding to the auditory cue that was previously paired with light compared to the unpaired cue. In contrast, PPC-lesioned rats responded equally to both auditory cues. In Experiment 2, PPC-lesioned and control rats were trained in a compound feature negative discrimination task consisting of reinforced presentations of a tone-alone and non-reinforced simultaneous presentations of a light-tone compound stimulus. Control rats but not rats with damage to the PPC successfully learned the discrimination. Collectively, these results support the idea that the PPC contributes to relational learning involving multimodal sensory stimuli, perhaps by regulating the attentional processing of conditioned stimuli.},

	abstract = {The retrosplenial cortex (RSP) is highly interconnected with medial temporal lobe structures, yet relatively little is known about its specific contributions to learning and memory. One possibility is that RSP is involved in forming associations between multiple sensory stimuli. Indeed, damage to RSP disrupts learning about spatial or contextual cues and also impairs learning about co-occurring conditioned stimuli (CSs). Two experiments were conducted to test this notion more rigorously. In Experiment 1, rats were trained in a serial feature negative discrimination task consisting of reinforced presentations of a tone alone and non-reinforced serial presentations of a light followed by the tone. Thus, in contrast to prior studies, this paradigm involved serial presentation of conditioned stimuli (CS), rather than simultaneous presentation. Rats with damage to RSP failed to acquire the discrimination, indicating that RSP is required for forming associations between sensory stimuli regardless of whether they occur serially or simultaneously. In Experiment 2, a sensory preconditioning task was used to determine if RSP was necessary for forming associations between stimuli even in the absence of reinforcement. During the first phase of this procedure, one auditory stimulus was paired with a light while a second auditory stimulus was presented alone. In the next phase of training, the same light was paired with food. During the final phase of the procedure both auditory stimuli were presented alone during a single session. Control, but not RSP-lesioned rats, exhibited more food cup behavior following presentation of the auditory cue that was previously paired with light compared to the unpaired auditory stimulus, indicating that a stimulus-stimulus association was formed during the first phase of training. These results support the idea that RSP has a fundamental role in forming associations between environmental stimuli.},

	abstract = {Human beings differ considerably in their ability to orient and navigate within the environment, but it has been difficult to determine specific causes of these individual differences. Permanent, stable landmarks are thought to be crucial for building a mental representation of an environment. Poor, compared to good, navigators have been shown to have difficulty identifying permanent landmarks, with a concomitant reduction in functional MRI (fMRI) activity in the retrosplenial cortex. However, a clear association between navigation ability and the learning of permanent landmarks has not been established. Here we tested for such a link. We had participants learn a virtual reality environment by repeatedly moving through it during fMRI scanning. The environment contained landmarks of which participants had no prior experience, some of which remained fixed in their locations while others changed position each time they were seen. After the fMRI learning phase, we divided participants into good and poor navigators based on their ability to find their way in the environment. The groups were closely matched on a range of cognitive and structural brain measures. Examination of the learning phase during scanning revealed that, while good and poor navigators learned to recognise the environment's landmarks at a similar rate, poor navigators were impaired at registering whether landmarks were stable or transient, and this was associated with reduced engagement of the retrosplenial cortex. Moreover, a mediation analysis showed that there was a significant effect of landmark permanence learning on navigation performance mediated through retrosplenial cortex activity. We conclude that a diminished ability to process landmark permanence may be a contributory factor to sub-optimal navigation, and could be related to the level of retrosplenial cortex engagement.},

Here, we mapped the spatial distribution of Aβ plaques across age in three APP-overexpression mouse lines (APP/PS1, Tg2576, and hAPP-J20) using in vivo labeling with methoxy-X04, high throughput whole brain imaging, and an automated informatics pipeline. Images were acquired with high resolution serial two-photon tomography and labeled plaques were detected using custom-built segmentation algorithms. Image series were registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework, a 3D reference atlas, enabling automated brain-wide quantification of plaque density, number, and location. In both APP/PS1 and Tg2576 mice, plaques were identified first in isocortex, followed by olfactory, hippocampal, and cortical subplate areas. In hAPP-J20 mice, plaque density was highest in hippocampal areas, followed by isocortex, with little to no involvement of olfactory or cortical subplate areas. Within the major brain divisions, distinct regions were identified with high (or low) plaque accumulation; for example, the lateral visual area within the isocortex of APP/PS1 mice had relatively higher plaque density compared with other cortical areas, while in hAPP-J20 mice, plaques were densest in the ventral retrosplenial cortex. In summary, we show how whole brain imaging of amyloid pathology in mice reveals the extent to which a given model recapitulates the regional Aβ deposition patterns described in AD.},

	abstract = {The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is involved in a broad range of cognitive functions, integrating rich sensory, motor, and spatial signals from multiple brain areas, including the hippocampal system. RSC neurons show hippocampus-dependent activity reminiscent of place cell sequences. Using cellular calcium imaging in a virtual reality (VR)-based locomotion task, we investigate how the integration of visual and locomotor inputs may give rise to such activity in RSC. A substantial population shows neural sequences that track position in the VR environment. This activity is driven by the conjunction of visual stimuli sequences and active movement, which is suggestive of path integration. The activity is anchored to a reference point and predominantly follows the VR upon manipulations of optic ﬂow against locomotion. Thus, locomotion-gated optic ﬂow, combined with the presence of contextual cues at the start of each trial, is sufﬁcient to drive the sequential activity. A subpopulation shows landmark-related visual responses that are modulated by animal’s position in the VR. Thus, rather than fragmenting the spatial representation into equivalent locomotion-based ensemble versus optic-ﬂow-based ensemble, in RSC, optic ﬂow appears to override locomotion signals coherently in the population, when the gain between the two signals is altered.},

Current visualization of Aβ plaques in brains of live patients and animal models is limited in specificity and resolution. The retina as an extension of the brain portrays an appealing target for a live, noninvasive optical imaging of AD if disease pathology is manifested there. We identified retinal Aβ plaques in postmortem eyes from AD patients (n=8) and in suspected early stage cases (n=5), consistent with brain pathology and clinical reports; plaques were undetectable in age-matched non-AD individuals (n=5). In APPSWE/PS1ΔE9 transgenic mice (AD-Tg; n=18) and not in non-Tg wt mice (n=10), retinal Aβ plaques were detected following systemic administration of curcumin, a safe plaque-labeling fluorochrome. Moreover, retinal plaques were detectable earlier than in the brain and accumulated with disease progression. An immune-based therapy effective in reducing brain plaques, significantly reduced retinal Aβ plaque burden in immunized versus non-immunized AD mice (n=4 mice per group). In live AD-Tg mice (n=24), systemic administration of curcumin allowed noninvasive optical imaging of retinal Aβ plaques in vivo with high resolution and specificity; plaques were undetectable in non-Tg wt mice (n=11). Our discovery of Aβ specific plaques in retinas from AD patients, and the ability to noninvasively detect individual retinal plaques in live AD mice establish the basis for developing high resolution optical imaging for early AD diagnosis, prognosis assessment and response to therapies.},

Two-thirds of the cells fired differentially as the rat traversed the common stem on left-turn and right-turn trials, even when potentially confounding variations in running speed, heading, and position on the stem were taken into account. Other cells fired differentially on the two trial types in combination with behavioral and spatial factors or appeared to fire similarly on both trial types.

	abstract = {There is substantial evidence that hippocampus plays an important role in the processing of contextual information. Its speciﬁc role, however, remains unclear. One possibility is that single hippocampal neurons represent context information so that local circuits can construct representations of the current context, and the context that is expected based on past experience. Population codes derived from input by multiple local circuits may then engage match–mismatch algorithms that compare current and expected context information to determine the extent to which an expected context has changed. The results of such match–mismatch comparisons can be used to discriminate contexts. When context changes are detected, efferent messages may be passed on to connected neocortical areas so that informed “decisions” regarding future behavioral and cognitive strategies can be made. Here, a brief review describes evidence that a primary consequence of hippocampal processing is the discrimination of meaningful contexts. Then, the functional signiﬁcance of neocortical circuits that likely receive hippocampal output messages are described in terms of their contribution to the control of ongoing behavioral and cognitive strategy, especially during active navigation. It is clear from this systems view that studies of spatial navigation continue to provide researchers with an excellent model of hippocampal–neocortical interactions during learning.

The present experiment tested the hypothesis that if the visual landmarks were mobile, place cells would learn to disregard these and rely on idiothetic cues instead. Place cells were recorded in a square box surrounded by circular black curtains. A cue card hung on the curtain behind one of the walls to break the fourfold symmetry. The relative influence of this card on the location of place fields was assessed each day by confining the rat on a rotating platter underneath an opaque cover, and then rotating the card and the platter by different amounts, to see whether subsequently recorded place fields had rotated with the card or with the rat. For some rats, these trials had been preceded by trials in which the card had been visibly moved from trial to trial, so that the rats had seen that it was mobile. Other rats received no prior visual information that the card was mobile. In the rats that had previously seen the card move, place fields initially rotated with the card but by the end of five sessions usually rotated with the rat instead. For rats that had never seen the card move, place fields always followed the card. Thus, the cells were able to “learn” that their preferred directional input, the card, was unreliable. A third group of rats, who were covered only for 30 s while the card was moved, showed mixed behaviour, suggesting a degradation of the idiothetic trace with time.},

However, if such a directional cue is made unreliable by being frequently moved in full view of the rat, the rat’s internal sense of direction comes, over the course of a few days, to control the orientation of place ﬁelds instead. We investigated whether this simple form of ‘cue-instability’ learning would transfer to a new context, in which the ﬁring patterns of the place cells become reorganized and in which a new spatial representation is thus active. We found that after cue-instability learning, the ‘remapped’ place ﬁeld representation in the new environment was also orientated by the internal sense of direction of the rat rather than by the cue card, showing that the cue learning generalized from one context (and hence spatial representation) to another. This contrasts with another kind of place cell learning, in which the cells can acquire the ability to discriminate two spatial locations in one context but do not transfer this discrimination to a new context. We discuss the different effects of context changes on learned place cell activity in terms of the possible architecture of the inputs to place cells.},

RSC neurons show hippocampus-dependent activity reminiscent of place cell sequences. Using cellular calcium imaging in a virtual reality (VR)-based locomotion task, we investigate how the integration of visual and locomotor inputs may give rise to such activity in RSC. A substantial population shows neural sequences that track position in the VR environment. This activity is driven by the conjunction of visual stimuli sequences and active movement, which is suggestive of path integration. The activity is anchored to a reference point and predominantly follows the VR upon manipulations of optic flow against locomotion. Thus, locomotion-gated optic flow, combined with the presence of contextual cues at the start of each trial, is sufficient to drive the sequential activity. A subpopulation shows landmark-related visual responses that are modulated by animal’s position in the VR. Thus, rather than fragmenting the spatial representation into equivalent locomotion-based ensemble versus optic-flow-based ensemble, in RSC, optic flow appears to override locomotion signals coherently in the population, when the gain between the two signals is altered.},

In this study the variation in the shape of the directional tuning proﬁles among a population of cells recorded from the arm area of the motor cortex of monkeys using movements in 20 directions, every 18°, was examined systematically. This allowed the investigation of tuning functions with extra parameters to capture additional features of the tuning curve (i.e. tuning breadth, symmetry, and modality) and determine an ‘optimal’ tuning function. These functions provided better ﬁt than the standard cosine one. The optimal function for the large majority of tuned cells was unimodal (84\%), and only for a few of them (16\%) it was bimodal. Of the unimodal cells, 73\% exhibited symmetric and 27\% asymmetric shape. The half-width, {\textbar}, at the midpoint of optimal tuning curves differed among cells from 30 to 90°, with a median at 56°. This is much narrower than in the standard cosine tuning function with a ﬁxed width of {\textbar}=90°. It was concluded that motor cortical cells are more sharply tuned than previously thought. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This integration includes discussions of our current understanding of the role of the hippocampal system in experience-dependent navigation, how hippocampal information comes to impact midbrain and striatal decision making systems, and finally the role of the striatum in the implementation of behaviors based on recent decisions. These discussions extend across cellular to neural systems levels of analysis. Not only are key findings described, but also fundamental organizing principles within and across neural systems, as well as between neural systems functions and behavior, are emphasized.

Recent recordings from rodent hippocampus in decision-making situations have found transient forward-shifted representations. Evaluation of that prediction and subsequent action-selection likely occurs downstream (e.g. in orbitofrontal cortex, in ventral and dorsomedial striatum). Classically, striatum has been identified as a critical component of the less-flexible, incremental system. Current evidence, however, suggests that striatum is involved in both flexible and stimulus-response decision-making, with dorsolateral striatum involved in stimulus-response strategies and ventral and dorsomedial striatum involved in goal-directed strategies.},

Studies in humans and rodents suggest that retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a key role in these computations. We developed an RSCdependent behavioral task in which head-fixed mice learned the spatial relationship between visual landmark cues and hidden reward locations. Two-photon imaging revealed that these cues served as dominant reference points for most task-active neurons and anchored the spatial code in RSC. This encoding was more robust after task acquisition. Decoupling the virtual environment from mouse behavior degraded spatial representations and provided evidence that supralinear integration of visual and motor inputs contributes to landmark encoding. V1 axons recorded in RSC were less modulated by task engagement but showed surprisingly similar spatial tuning. Our data indicate that landmark representations in RSC are the result of local integration of visual, motor, and spatial information.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Anxiety is postulated to be a modiﬁable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our primary aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies investigating the association between anxiety and AD risk. Design: We searched multiple scientiﬁc databases to identify relevant papers published up to March 2019. Inclusion criteria were: prospective cohort studies with a minimum follow-up period of 1 year, baseline anxiety assessment, absence of dementia at baseline, investigated the association between anxiety and AD incidence, and reporting Relative Risks (RRs), or equivalents (HRs and SHRs), for the association between anxiety and AD risk. We excluded studies that: focused on subjective memory or mild cognitive impairment samples, review and meta-analyses, not reporting original, published peer-reviewed results. We used a random-eﬀects model that accommodated the diﬀerences in association statistics.
Results: 7 prospective cohorts (reported in 6 studies), with a total of 24,528 participants, were included in our meta-analysis. A marginally signiﬁcant association between anxiety and AD risk was found, with a pooled RR of 1.45 (95\% CI: 1.00–2.12), and a population attributable fraction for AD of 2.8\% (95\% CI: 1.2\%–4.3\%). Limitations: There was a high level of heterogeneity across the studies, which may be associated with diﬀerences in the covariates adjusted for. Studies also diﬀered considerably in how they measured anxiety.

            Failure of Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials to improve or stabilize cognition has led to the need for a better understanding of the driving forces behind cognitive decline in the presence of active disease processes. To dissect contributions of individual pathologies to cognitive function, we used the TgF344-AD rat model, which recapitulates the salient hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease pathology observed in patient populations (amyloid, tau inclusions, frank neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits). scyllo-Inositol treatment attenuated amyloid-β peptide in disease-bearing TgF344-AD rats, which rescued pattern separation in the novel object recognition task and executive function in the reversal learning phase of the Barnes maze. Interestingly, neither activities of daily living in the burrowing task nor spatial memory in the Barnes maze were rescued by attenuating amyloid-β peptide. To understand the pathological correlates leading to behavioural rescue, we examined the neuropathology and in vivo electrophysiological signature of the hippocampus. Amyloid-β peptide attenuation reduced hippocampal tau pathology and rescued adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal function, via improvements in cross-frequency coupling between theta and gamma bands. To investigate mechanisms underlying the persistence of spatial memory deficits, we next examined neuropathology in the entorhinal cortex, a region whose input to the hippocampus is required for spatial memory. Reduction of amyloid-β peptide in the entorhinal cortex had no effect on entorhinal tau pathology or entorhinal-hippocampal neuronal network dysfunction, as measured by an impairment in hippocampal response to entorhinal stimulation. Thus, rescue or not of cognitive function is dependent on regional differences of amyloid-β, tau and neuronal network dysfunction, demonstrating the importance of staging disease in patients prior to enrolment in clinical trials. These results further emphasize the need for combination therapeutic approaches across disease progression.},

	abstract = {Background: Abnormal accumulation of amyloid β1–42 oligomers (AβO1–42), a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, impairs hippocampal theta-nested gamma oscillations and long-term potentiation (LTP) that are believed to underlie learning and memory. Parvalbumin-positive (PV) and somatostatin-positive (SST) interneurons are critically involved in theta-nested gamma oscillogenesis and LTP induction. However, how AβO1–42 affects PV and SST interneuron circuits is unclear. Through optogenetic manipulation of PV and SST interneurons and computational modeling of the hippocampal neural circuits, we dissected the contributions of PV and SST interneuron circuit dysfunctions on AβO1–42-induced impairments of hippocampal theta-nested gamma oscillations and oscillation-induced LTP.
Results: Targeted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and optogenetic manipulations of PV and SST interneurons during in vivo-like, optogenetically induced theta-nested gamma oscillations in vitro revealed that AβO1–42 causes synapse-specific dysfunction in PV and SST interneurons. AβO1–42 selectively disrupted CA1 pyramidal cells (PC)-to-PV interneuron and PV-to-PC synapses to impair theta-nested gamma oscillogenesis. In contrast, while having no effect on PC-to-SST or SST-to-PC synapses, AβO1–42 selectively disrupted SST interneuron-mediated disinhibition to CA1 PC to impair theta-nested gamma oscillation-induced spike timing-dependent LTP (tLTP). Such AβO1–42-induced impairments of gamma oscillogenesis and oscillation-induced tLTP were fully restored by optogenetic activation of PV and SST interneurons, respectively, further supporting synapse-specific dysfunctions in PV and SST interneurons. Finally, computational modeling of hippocampal neural circuits including CA1 PC, PV, and SST interneurons confirmed the experimental observations and further revealed distinct functional roles of PV and SST interneurons in theta-nested gamma oscillations and tLTP induction.
Conclusions: Our results reveal that AβO1–42 causes synapse-specific dysfunctions in PV and SST interneurons and that optogenetic modulations of these interneurons present potential therapeutic targets for restoring hippocampal network oscillations and synaptic plasticity impairments in Alzheimer’s disease.},

Little is known about GABAergic interneurons of this region. Here, we used three transgenic mouse lines, Pvalb-Cre, Sst-Cre, and X98, to examine distinct interneurons labeled with tdTomato or green fluorescent protein. The distribution of interneurons in presubicular lamina for each animal line was compared to that in the GAD67-GFP knock-in animal line. Labeling was specific in the Pvalb-Cre line with 87\% of labeled interneurons immunopositive for parvalbumin (PV). Immunostaining for somatostatin (SOM) revealed good specificity in the X98 line with 89\% of fluorescent cells, but a lesser specificity in Sst-Cre animals where only 71\% of labeled cells were immunopositive. A minority of ∼6\% of interneurons co-expressed PV and SOM in the presubiculum of Sst-Cre animals. The electrophysiological and morphological properties of fluorescent interneurons from Pvalb-Cre, Sst-Cre, and X98 mice differed. Distinct physiological groups of presubicular interneurons were resolved by unsupervised cluster analysis of parameters describing passive properties, firing patterns and AP shapes. One group consisted of SOM-positive, Martinotti type neurons with a low firing threshold (cluster 1). Fast spiking basket cells, mainly from the Pvalb-Cre line, formed a distinct group (cluster 3). Another group (cluster 2) contained interneurons of intermediate electrical properties and basket-cell like morphologies. These labeled neurons were recorded from both Sst-Cre and Pvalb-Cre animals. Thus, our results reveal a wide variation in anatomical and physiological properties for these interneurons, a real overlap of interneurons immuno-positive for both PV and SOM as well as an off-target recombination in the Sst-Cre line, possibly linked to maternal cre inheritance.},

Multiple-site monitoring of units allowed for the determination of their two-dimensional spatial position in the brain. Of the ∼60,000 cell pairs recorded, 0.2\% showed robust short-term interactions. Units with significant, short-latency ({\textless}3 ms) peaks following their action potentials in their cross-correlograms were characterized as putative excitatory (pyramidal) cells. Units with significant suppression of spiking of their partners were regarded as putative GABAergic interneurons. A portion of the putative interneurons was reciprocally connected with pyramidal cells. Neurons physiologically identified as inhibitory and excitatory cells were used as templates for classification of all recorded neurons. Of the several parameters tested, the duration of the unfiltered (1 Hz to 5 kHz) spike provided the most reliable clustering of the population. High-density parallel recordings of neuronal activity, determination of their physical location and their classification into pyramidal and interneuron classes provide the necessary tools for local circuit analysis.},

Although these plaques may have harmful properties, there is much evidence to implicate soluble oligomeric Aβ as the primary noxious form. Aβ oligomers can be generated both extracellularly and intracellularly. Aβ is toxic to neurons in a myriad of ways. It can cause pore formation resulting in the leakage of ions, disruption of cellular calcium balance, and loss of membrane potential. It can promote apoptosis, cause synaptic loss, and disrupt the cytoskeleton. Current treatments for AD are limited and palliative. Much research and effort is being devoted to reducing Aβ production as an approach to slowing or preventing the development of AD. Aβ formation results from the amyloidogenic cleavage of human amyloid precursor protein (APP). Reconfiguring this process to disfavor amyloid generation might be possible through the reduction of APP or inhibition of enzymes that convert the precursor protein to amyloid.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Epileptic activity is frequently associated with Alzheimer’s disease; this association has therapeutic implications, because epileptic activity can occur at early disease stages and might contribute to pathogenesis. In clinical practice, seizures in patients with Alzheimer’s disease can easily go unrecognised because they usually present as non-motor seizures, and can overlap with other symptoms of the disease. In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, seizures can hasten cognitive decline, highlighting the clinical relevance of early recognition and treatment. Some evidence indicates that subclinical epileptiform activity in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, detected by extended neurophysiological monitoring, can also lead to accelerated cognitive decline. Treatment of clinical seizures in patients with Alzheimer’s disease with select antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), in low doses, is usually well tolerated and efficacious. Moreover, studies in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease suggest that certain classes of AEDs that reduce network hyperexcitability have disease-modifying properties. These AEDs target mechanisms of epileptogenesis involving amyloid β and tau. Clinical trials targeting network hyperexcitability in patients with Alzheimer’s disease will identify whether AEDs or related strategies could improve their cognitive symptoms or slow decline.},

	abstract = {Synaptic dysfunction is widely proposed as an initial insult leading to the neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We hypothesize that the initial insult originates in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) due to deﬁcits in key interneuronal functions and synaptic signaling mechanisms, in particular, Wnt (Wingless/integrated). To investigate this hypothesis, we utilized the ﬁrst knock-in mouse model of AD (AppNL-F/NL-F), expressing a mutant form of human amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein. This model shows an age-dependent accumulation of Aβ, neuroinﬂammation, and neurodegeneration. Prior to the typical AD pathology, we showed a decrease in canonical Wnt signaling activity ﬁrst affecting the LEC in combination with synaptic hyperexcitation and severely disrupted excitatory–inhibitory inputs onto principal cells. This synaptic imbalance was consistent with a reduction in the number of parvalbumin-containing (PV) interneurons, and a reduction in the somatic inhibitory axon terminals in the LEC compared with other cortical regions. However, targeting GABAA receptors on PV cells using allosteric modulators, diazepam, zolpidem, or a nonbenzodiazepine, L-838,417 (modulator of α2/3 subunit-containing GABAA receptors), restored the excitatory–inhibitory imbalance observed at principal cells in the LEC. These data support our hypothesis, providing a rationale for targeting the synaptic imbalance in the LEC for early stage therapeutic intervention to prevent neurodegeneration in AD.},

Here, we report that hAPP mice have spontaneous nonconvulsive seizure activity in cortical and hippocampal networks, which is associated with GABAergic sprouting, enhanced synaptic inhibition, and synaptic plasticity deficits in the dentate gyrus. Many Aβ-induced neuronal alterations could be simulated in nontransgenic mice by excitotoxin challenge and prevented in hAPP mice by blocking overexcitation.

Abnormal amyloid β-protein (Aβ) deposition in the brain is often thought of as a major initiating factor in AD neuropathology. However, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory interneurons are resistant to Aβ deposition, and Aβ decreases synaptic glutamatergic transmission to decrease neural network activity. Furthermore, there is now evidence suggesting that neural network activity is aberrantly increased in AD patients and animal models due to functional deficits in and decreased activity of GABA inhibitory interneurons, contributing to cognitive deficits. Here we describe the roles played by excitatory neurons and GABA inhibitory interneurons in Aβ-induced cognitive deficits and how altered GABA interneurons regulate AD neuropathology. We also comprehensively review recent studies on how GABA interneurons and GABA receptors can be exploited for therapeutic benefit.

Diverse lines of evidence suggest that amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides have a causal role in its pathogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. Here we discuss recent evidence that Aβ may be part of a mechanism controlling synaptic activity, acting as a positive regulator presynaptically and a negative regulator postsynaptically. The pathological accumulation of oligomeric Aβ assemblies depresses excitatory transmission at the synaptic level, but also triggers aberrant patterns of neuronal circuit activity and epileptiform discharges at the network level. Aβ-induced dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons likely increases synchrony among excitatory principal cells and contributes to the destabilization of neuronal networks. Strategies that block these Aβ effects may prevent cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Potential obstacles and next steps toward this goal are discussed.},

Unlike neuritic plaques in the CA1, Aβ lesions in the presubiculum were not accompanied by inflammatory gliosis enriched with 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). Thus, there are at least two different components in Aβ aggregates providing distinct binding sites for the current amyloid radioligands, and one of these binding components is distinctly present in the presubicular Aβ deposits. Amyloid radioligands lacking affinity for this component, such as 125I-DRM106, may selectively capture Aβ deposits tightly associated with TSPO neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration as exemplified by CA1 neuritic plaques. Hence, comparative autoradiographic assessments of radioligand binding in CA1 and presubiculum could serve for the development of an amyloid PET imaging agent visualizing neurotoxicity-related Aβ pathologies. Non-invasive determination of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) serves for the early diagnosis and clarification of pathogenetic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Importantly, the brain appears to show differential changes throughout the aging process, with certain regions (e.g. frontal and temporal regions) being more vulnerable than others (e.g. brain stem).

Learning-related increases in intrinsic excitability of neurons occurs in a variety of brain regions, and is generally thought to promote information processing and storage through enhancement of synaptic throughput and induction of synaptic plasticity. Experience-dependent changes in intrinsic neuronal excitability rely on activity-dependent gene expression patterns, which can be influenced by genetic and environmental factors, aging, and disease. Reductions in baseline intrinsic excitability, as well as aberrant plasticity of intrinsic neuronal excitability and in some cases pathological hyperexcitability, have been associated with cognitive deficits in animal models of both normal cognitive aging and Alzheimer’s disease. Genetic factors that modulate plasticity of intrinsic excitability likely underlie individual differences in cognitive function and susceptibility to cognitive decline. Thus, targeting molecular mediators that either control baseline intrinsic neuronal excitability, subserve learning-related intrinsic neuronal plasticity, and/or promote resilience may be a promising therapeutic strategy for maintaining cognitive function in aging and disease. In this review, we discuss the complementary relationship between intrinsic excitability and learning, with a particular focus on how this relationship varies as a function of age, disease state, and genetic make-up, and how targeting these factors may help to further elucidate our understanding of the role of intrinsic excitability in cognitive function and cognitive decline.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            A variety of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse models overexpress mutant forms of human amyloid precursor protein (APP), producing high levels of amyloid β (Aβ) and forming plaques However, the degree to which these models mimic spatiotemporal patterns of Aβ deposition in brains of AD patients is unknown. Here, we mapped the spatial distribution of Aβ plaques across ages in three APP-overexpression mouse lines (APP/PS1, Tg2576, hAPP-J20) using
            in vivo
            labeling with methoxy-X04, high throughput whole brain imaging, and an automated informatics pipeline. Images were acquired with high resolution serial 2-photon tomography and labeled plaques were detected using custom-built segmentation algorithms.

            A variety of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse models overexpress mutant forms of human amyloid precursor protein (APP), producing high levels of amyloid β (Aβ) and forming plaques However, the degree to which these models mimic spatiotemporal patterns of Aβ deposition in brains of AD patients is unknown. Here, we mapped the spatial distribution of Aβ plaques across ages in three APP-overexpression mouse lines (APP/PS1, Tg2576, hAPP-J20) using
            in vivo
            labeling with methoxy-X04, high throughput whole brain imaging, and an automated informatics pipeline. Images were acquired with high resolution serial 2-photon tomography and labeled plaques were detected using custom-built segmentation algorithms. Image series were registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework, a 3D reference atlas, enabling automated brain-wide quantification of plaque density, number, and location. In both APP/PS1 and Tg2576 mice, plaques were identified first in isocortex, followed by olfactory, hippocampal, and cortical subplate areas.

The nuclei of the mammillary bodies demonstrated a substantial decrease in the neuronal population and marked abbreviation of dendritic arbors. Decrease in spine density and morphological abnormalities of dendritic spines was also seen. Synaptic alterations were prominent. Alzheimer’s pathology, such as deposits of amyloid-β peptide and neurofibrillary degeneration, was minimal.

Although they represent a minority of the total neocortical neuronal population, GABAergic interneurons are highly heterogeneous, forming functional classes based on their morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular features, as well as connectivity and in vivo patterns of activity. Here we review our current understanding of neocortical interneuron diversity and the properties that distinguish cell types. We then discuss how the involvement of multiple cell types, each with a specific set of cellular properties, plays a crucial role in diversifying and increasing the computational power of a relatively small number of simple circuit motifs forming cortical networks. We illustrate how recent advances in the field have shed light onto the mechanisms by which GABAergic inhibition contributes to network operations.},

Here we report that pathological tau accumulation takes place predominantly in excitatory neurons compared to inhibitory neurons, not only in the entorhinal cortex, a brain region affected in early Alzheimer’s disease, but also in areas affected later by the disease. By analyzing RNA transcripts from single-nucleus RNA datasets, we identified a specific tau homeostasis signature of genes differentially expressed in excitatory compared to inhibitory neurons. One of the genes, BCL2 associated athanogene 3BAG3, a facilitator of autophagy, was identified as a hub or master regulator, gene. We verified that reducing BAG3 levels in primary neurons exacerbated pathological tau accumulation whereas overexpression attenuated it. These results support the conclusion that tau homeostasis underlies the cellular and regional vulnerability of excitatory neurons to tau pathology., Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.},

Interneuron death and reorganization during epileptogenesis may disrupt the synchrony of hippocampal inhibition. To test this, we simultaneously recorded from the CA1 and dentate gyrus in pilocarpine-treated epileptic mice with silicon probes during head-fixed virtual navigation. We found desynchronized interneuron firing between the CA1 and dentate gyrus in epileptic mice. Since hippocampal interneurons control information processing, we tested whether CA1 spatial coding was altered in this desynchronized circuit, using a novel wire-free miniscope. We found that CA1 place cells in epileptic mice were unstable and completely remapped across a week. This spatial instability emerged around 6 weeks after status epilepticus, well after the onset of chronic seizures and interneuron death. Finally, CA1 network modeling showed that desynchronized inputs can impair the precision and stability of CA1 place cells. Together, these results demonstrate that temporally precise intrahippocampal communication is critical for spatial processing.},

We find that in the hours following single-trial contextual fear conditioning (CFC), fast-spiking interneurons (which typically express parvalbumin (PV)) show greater firing coherence with CA1 network oscillations. Post-CFC inhibition of PV+ interneurons blocks fear memory consolidation. This effect is associated with loss of two network changes associated with normal consolidation: (1) augmented sleep-associated delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–12 Hz) and ripple (150–250 Hz) oscillations; and (2) stabilization of CA1 neurons’ functional connectivity patterns. Rhythmic activation of PV+ interneurons increases CA1 network coherence and leads to a sustained increase in the strength and stability of functional connections between neurons. Our results suggest that immediately following learning, PV+ interneurons drive CA1 oscillations and reactivation of CA1 ensembles, which directly promotes network plasticity and long-term memory formation.},

Subsets of synaptic input can be selected or 'gated' by precise modulation of finely tuned EI balance, but assessing the granularity of EI balance requires combinatorial analysis of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Using patterned optogenetic stimulation of mouse hippocampal CA3 neurons, we show that hundreds of unique CA3 input combinations recruit excitation and inhibition with a nearly identical ratio, demonstrating precise EI balance at the hippocampus. Crucially, the delay between excitation and inhibition decreases as excitatory input increases from a few synapses to tens of synapses. This creates a dynamic millisecond-range window for postsynaptic excitation, controlling membrane depolarization amplitude and timing via subthreshold divisive normalization. We suggest that this combination of precise EI balance and dynamic EI delays forms a general mechanism for millisecond-range input gating and subthreshold gain control in feedforward networks.},

We employed a pharmacogenetic approach to silence either parvalbumin (PV)- or somatostatin (SOM)-expressing interneurons while MEC cells were recorded in freely moving mice. PV-cell silencing antagonized the hexagonally patterned spatial selectivity of grid cells, especially in layer II of MEC. The impairment was accompanied by reduced speed modulation in colocalized speed cells. Silencing SOM cells, in contrast, had no impact on grid cells or speed cells but instead decreased the spatial selectivity of cells with discrete aperiodic firing fields. Border cells and head direction cells were not affected by either intervention. The findings point to distinct roles for PV and SOM interneurons in the local dynamics underlying periodic and aperiodic firing in spatially modulated cells of the MEC.

Here, we examine how thalamic afferents recruit presubicular principal neurons and Martinotti interneurons, and the ensuing synaptic interactions between these cells. Pyramidal neuron activation of Martinotti cells in superficial layers is strongly facilitating such that high-frequency head directional stimulation efficiently unmutes synaptic excitation. Martinotti-cell feedback plays a dual role: precisely timed spikes may not inhibit the firing of in-tune head direction cells, while exerting lateral inhibition. Autonomous attractor dynamics emerge from a modelled network implementing wiring motifs and timing sensitive synaptic interactions in the pyramidal—Martinotti-cell feedback loop. This inhibitory microcircuit is therefore tuned to refine and maintain head direction information in the presubiculum.},

	abstract = {The presubiculum, located between hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, plays a fundamental role in representing spatial information, notably head direction. Little is known about GABAergic interneurons of this region. Here, we used three transgenic mouse lines, Pvalb-Cre, Sst-Cre and X98, to examine distinct interneurons labeled with tdTomato or green fluorescent protein. The distribution of interneurons in presubicular lamina for each animal line was compared to that in the GAD67-GFP knock-in animal line. Labelling was specific in the Pvalb-Cre line with 87\% of labeled interneurons immunopositive for (PV). Immunostaining for somatostatin (SOM) revealed good specificity in the X98 line with 89\% of fluorescent cells, but a lesser specificity in Sst-Cre animals where only 71\% of labeled cells were immunopositive. A minority of {\textasciitilde} 6\% of interneurons co-expressed PV and SOM in the presubiculum of Sst-Cre animals. The electrophysiological and morphological properties of fluorescent interneurons from Pvalb-Cre, Sst-Cre and X98 mice differed. Distinct physiological groups of presubicular interneurons were resolved by unsupervised cluster analysis of parameters describing passive properties, firing patterns and AP shapes. One group consisted of SOM-positive, Martinotti type neurons with a low firing threshold (cluster 1). Fast spiking basket cells, mainly from the Pvalb-Cre line, formed a distinct group (cluster 3). Another group (cluster 2) contained interneurons of intermediate electrical properties and basket-cell like morphologies. These labeled neurons were recorded from both Sst-Cre and Pvalb-Cre animals. Thus, our results reveal a wide variation in anatomical and physiological properties for these interneurons, a real overlap of interneurons immuno-positive for both PV and SOM as well as an off-target recombination in the Sst-Cre line, possibly linked to maternal cre inheritance.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) frequently suffer from spatial memory impairment and wandering behavior, but brain circuits causing such symptoms remain largely unclear. In healthy brains, spatially-tuned hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells represent distinct spike patterns in different environments, a circuit function called “remapping” that underlies pattern separation of spatial memory. We investigated whether knock-in expression of mutated amyloid precursor protein deteriorates the remapping of place cells and grid cells. We found that the remapping of CA1 place cells was disrupted although their spatial tuning was only mildly diminished. Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) were impaired, sending severely disrupted remapping signals to the hippocampus. Furthermore, fast gamma oscillations were disrupted in both CA1 and MEC, resulting in impaired fast gamma coupling in the MEC→CA1 circuit. These results point to the link between grid cell impairment and remapping disruption as a circuit mechanism causing spatial memory impairment in AD.},

	abstract = {GABAergic parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons provide powerful inhibitory modulation of grid cells in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC LII). However, the molecular machinery through which PV+ cells regulate grid cell activity is poorly defined. PV+ interneurons impart inhibitory modulation primarily via GABA-A receptors (GABAARs). GABAARs are pentameric ion channels assembled from a repertoire of 19 subunits. Multiple subunit combinations result in a variety of receptor subtypes mediating functionally diverse postsynaptic inhibitory currents. Whilst the broad expression patterns of GABAAR subunits within the EC have been reported, those expressed by individual MEC LII cell types, in particular grid cells candidates, stellate and pyramidal cells, are less well described. Stellate and pyramidal cells are distinguished by their selective expression of reelin (RE+) and calbindin (CB+) respectively. Thus, the overall aim of this study was to provide a high resolution analysis of the major (α and γ) GABAAR subunits expressed in proximity to somato-dendritic PV+ boutons, on RE+ and CB+ cells, using immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). Clusters immunoreactive for the α1 and γ2 subunits decorated the somatic membranes of both RE+ and CB+ cells and were predominantly located in apposition to clusters immunoreactive for PV and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), suggesting expression in GABAergic synapses innervated by PV interneurons. Although intense α2 subunit-immunopositive clusters were evident in hippocampal fields located in close proximity to the EC, no specific signal was detected in MEC LII RE+ and CB+ profiles. Immunoreactivity for the α3 subunit was detected in all RE+ somata. In contrast, only a sub-population of CB+ cells was α3 immunopositive. These included CB-α3 cells which were both PV+ and PV-. Furthermore, α3 subunit mRNA and immunofluorescence decreased significantly between P 15 and P 25, a period implicated in the functional maturation of grid cells. Finally, α5 subunit immunoreactivity was detectable only on CB+ cells, not on RE+ cells. The present data demonstrates that physiologically distinct GABAAR subtypes are selectively expressed by CB+ and RE+ cells. This suggests that PV+ interneurons could utilize distinct postsynaptic signaling mechanisms to regulate the excitability of these different, candidate grid cell sub-populations.},

	abstract = {Apoptosis, or cellular suicide, is important for normal development and tissue homeostasis, but too much or too little apoptosis can also cause disease1,2. The family of cysteine proteases, the so-called caspases, are critical mediators of programmed cell death3, and thus far 14 family members have been identified. Some of these, such as caspase-8 (refs 4, 5), mediate signal transduction downstream of death receptors located on the plasma membrane. Others, such as caspase-9 (ref. 6), mediate apoptotic signals after mitochondrial damage. Stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can also result in apoptosis7. Here we show that caspase-12 is localized to the ER and activated by ER stress, including disruption of ER calcium homeostasis and accumulation of excess proteins in ER, but not by membrane- or mitochondrial-targeted apoptotic signals. Mice that are deficient in caspase-12 are resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis, but their cells undergo apoptosis in response to other death stimuli. Furthermore, we show that caspase-12-deficient cortical neurons are defective in apoptosis induced by amyloid-β protein but not by staurosporine or trophic factor deprivation. Thus, caspase-12 mediates an ER-specific apoptosis pathway and may contribute to amyloid-β neurotoxicity.},

	abstract = {Cortical neurons in vivo had been regarded as Poisson spike generators that convey no information other than the rate of random firing. Recently, using a metric for analyzing local variation of interspike intervals, researchers have found that individual neurons express specific patterns in generating spikes, which may symbolically be termed regular, random, or bursty, rather invariantly in time. In order to study the dynamics of firing patterns in greater detail, we propose here a Bayesian method for estimating firing irregularity and the firing rate simultaneously for a given spike sequence, and we implement an algorithm that may render the empirical Bayesian estimation practicable for data comprising a large number of spikes. Application of this method to electrophysiological data revealed a subtle correlation between the degree of firing irregularity and the firing rate for individual neurons. Irregularity of firing did not deviate greatly around the low degree of dependence on the firing rate and remained practically unchanged for individual neurons in the cortical areas V1 and MT, whereas it fluctuated greatly in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. This indicates the presence and absence of autocontrolling mechanisms for maintaining patterns of firing in the cortex and thalamus, respectively.},

We found that a measure of the local variation of interspike intervals, LV, is nearly the same for every spike sequence for any given neuron, while it varies significantly among neurons. The distributions of LV values for neuron ensembles in three of the four areas were found to be distinctly bimodal. Two groups of neurons classified according to the spiking irregularity exhibit different responses to the same stimulus.

Here, we apply an unbiased statistical approach to search for cells that encode navigationally relevant variables. This approach successfully classiﬁes the majority of entorhinal cells and reveals unsuspected entorhinal coding principles. First, we ﬁnd a high degree of mixed selectivity and heterogeneity in superﬁcial entorhinal neurons. Second, we discover a dynamic and remarkably adaptive code for space that enables entorhinal cells to rapidly encode navigational information accurately at high running speeds. Combined, these observations advance our current understanding of the mechanistic origins and functional implications of the entorhinal code for navigation.},
