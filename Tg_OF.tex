\begin{abstract}
Spatial navigation is impaired in early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This impairment is thought to arise from a deficit in transitioning between or using cues within two key reference frames; allocentric (body independent) and egocentric (body dependent). Use of cues for navigation within the allocentric reference frame becomes impaired in AD very early in the disease progression. Studies of exploratory behaviors in rodents may reveal how these cue-cue or cue-body relationships form by tracking the behaviors of rodents in an open field environment denoted with a proximal cue. The TgF344-AD rat model of AD has been shown to develop a comprehensive profile of AD pathology which progressively worsens performance in spatial memory tasks. However, it is currently unknown how TgF344-AD rats gather spatial information during open-field exploration. This study assessed 13-month-old male and female TgF344-AD rats and F344 controls over two days in a large open field task. Exploratory behaviors were assessed in the presence of a proximal cue and 24 h later once the cue was removed. Results indicate that TgF344-AD rats and controls shared similar locomotion and exploratory behaviors. Additionally, both groups established home bases, though the location of the home bases was equally variable between days across both groups. Overall, this study indicates that TgF344-AD rats at 13 months of age show similar spatial memory and exploratory behaviors found in F344 controls.

\section*{Introduction}

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles resulting in neurodegeneration of key medial temporal lobe structures involved in learning and memory. One of the earliest memory complaints in AD involves an inability to accurately navigate from one location to another. 

Experimentally, these deficits are apparent in tasks that require locating hidden goals, which may reflect a loss in the use of allocentric (map-like or body-independent) information to guide behavior. Allocentric navigation deficits are frequently linked with the earliest stages of AD, while simpler forms of navigation (e.g., egocentric or body-dependent) remain largely unaffected until later in the disease's progression.

Studies of exploratory behaviors in rodents have provided insight into the organization of allocentric information processing by tracking the behaviors of rodents in open environments \cite{dudchenko_neuroethology_2018,poulter_neurobiology_2018,thompson_behavioral_2018}. For instance, when placed in an open field, rats organize their exploratory behaviors around particular locations, called home bases. At these locations, rats spend a disproportionate amount of time, perform prolonged crouching, grooming, circling, and rearing movements \cite{eilam_home_1989}, and make slow exploratory excursions into the remaining environment, followed by direct, rapid returns to the home base \cite{wallace_nmda_2003}. Although rats express home base behavior in relatively featureless environments and in darkness \cite{eilam_home_1989,hines_home_2005,nemati_point_2007}, they establish their bases near landmarks that offer security such as shelters, walls, or prominent visual cues \cite{clark_impaired_2005,hines_home_2005,lehmann_complete_2007,wallace_nmda_2003,whishaw_exploratory_2006}. If the landmark is displaced, animals tend to return and dwell near the previously cued base location, suggesting the retention of spatial information acquired during exploration \cite{clark_impaired_2005,hines_home_2005,lehmann_complete_2007}(Clark et al., 2006; Hines \& Whishaw, 2005; Lehmann et al., 2007; Travis et al., 2010). 

While the TgF344-AD rat model shows promise for the study for spatial navigation impairments \cite{berkowitz_progressive_2018}, very little is known regarding changes in open field behavior. In the present study, rats were placed individually onto an open circular table top and were allowed to explore for 30 minutes for two consecutive days. On Day 1, a proximal cue was positioned on the edge of the table, which served to bias the formation of a home base at that location. On Day 2, the proximal cue was removed from the open field. Results indicate that TgF344-AD rats show subtle changes in locomotion measures compared to F344 wild type controls (WT), including stopping for a shorter amount of time and making less circuitous movement segments. Additionally, both TgF344-AD and F344 rats showed variable preference in using the proximal cue for establishing a home base and responded similarly to the removal of the proximal cue during the probe test. Overall, these results indicate relatively intact exploratory behavior in TgF344-AD rats at 13 months.   

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Open Field Test}

\subsubsection*{General Locomotor Activity}
We first sought to assess whether TgF344-AD rats exhibited similar locomotor activity as WT controls (see Fig 1). Thus, we measured path length (cm), linear locomotor speed (cm/s), angular locomotor speed (degrees/s), and the exploration area (percentage of the open field explored). When placed on the large open field, the exploratory movements of both WT and TgF344-AD rats were limited to a small proportion of the maze and the movements were typically slow.  Overall, TgF344-AD rats traveled a similar total distance (t(22)=-0.075,p=0.941) (Fig.~\ref{locomotor_fig}A) and explored a similar proportion of maze area as control rats (Mann–Whitney U=51.0,p=0.118) (Fig.~\ref{locomotor_fig}B). Both groups also exhibited similar mean linear velocity, mean absolute angular velocity, and absolute median linear acceleration during active locomotion (all p > 0.201 )(Fig 1c, d \& e). In summary, our analyses above suggests that TgF344-AD rats travel similar distances and explored the open field to a similar extent to WT controls.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Excursions}
We characterized bouts of exploration by parsing epochs of active locomotion from paths. Briefly, excursions were found by first calculating instantaneous linear velocity for the length of the open field test. The velocity vector was then z-scored and thresholds were applied to find epochs of time where the rat's velocity exceeded two standard deviations above the mean. Excursions were defined as epochs of time that were at least 1 s in duration. The number of total of excursions were similar between TgF344-AD and WT groups (t(22)=-1.555, p=0.134). While the distance travelled during excursions was similar between groups (Mann–Whitney U=54.5,p=0.163) (Fig.~\ref{locomotor_fig}E), TgF344-AD rats tended to make less circuitous paths relative to WT controls (Mann–Whitney U=11.0, p<0.0001) (Fig.~\ref{locomotor_fig}F). 

\subsubsection*{Stops} We also measured the frequency and duration of stops. The number of total stops made by TgF344-AD rats was similar to WT controls (t(22)=0.675, p=0.506), and the stop duration was similar between groups (Mann–Whitney U=57.0,p=0.201). During stops, TgF344-AD rats exhibited a smaller average angular head velocity compared to WT controls (16.6 vs. 20.6 deg/sec), though this was not statistically significant (F (1,22) = 3.03, p = .09). 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{}
    \caption{Caption}
    \label{homebase_fig}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Home Base} We next investigated whether TgF344-AD and WT control rats established home bases in the open field. We defined the home base as a region of the open field in which rats spent a disproportionate amount of time moving slowly (i.e., stopped). In general, all rats in both groups exhibited a clear preference for a location in the open field. In many cases, rats established more than one home base with the median number of home bases similar between groups (X(1)2 = .16, p = .68). TgF344-AD rats and WT controls visited their primary home base location, defined as the home base with the greatest occupancy, within the first 2-3 minutes. Again, the elapsed time to primary home base establishment did not significantly differ between groups (X(1)2 = .01, p = .90). Furthermore, home base occupancy (F (1,22) = .03, p = .86) , area of home base (X(1)2 = 1.46, p = .22), and the number of stops at home bases (X(1)2 = 1.46, p = .22). Thus, home base behaviors were similar between TgF344-AD and WT controls. 

Proximal or salient visual cues have been shown to influence where a home base is established \cite{nemati_point_2007,hines_home_2005}. Thus, we sought to identify whether rats established home bases near the proximal cue by calculating the distance between the primary home base center and the closest edge to the proximal cue. Figure 3 shows a clear bimodal distribution, whereby some rats set up their primary home base near the cue (< 25cm) while other rats set up home bases nearly a meter or more from the cue boundary. Although TgF344-AD rats tended to establish a home base further from the cue boundary relative to WT controls (TgF344-AD median: 121 cm vs WT median 11cm), there was no significant difference in median home base distance from cue between groups  (X(1)2 = .65, p = .41). Overall, these results indicate that there was mixed preference in using the proximal cue to establish a home base location for either group.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Probe Test: Proximal Cue Removal}
Twenty-four hours after the open field test, a probe test was conducted in which the rats were returned to open field but with the proximal cue removed from the environment. Difference scores were computed to determine whether behavior change was different between groups across days. Changes in behaviors including locomotor distance, exploration area, linear speed, linear acceleration, angular velocity during exploration, angular velocity during stops, number of run epochs, or number of stops changed to the same extent between groups (supplemental table X). 

Previous work has shown that rats respond to the novelty of cue removal with frequent visits to the previously cued location typically within the first several minutes of testing \cite{hines_home_2005}(Hines et al., 2005; Travis et al., 2010). Only 50\% of TgF344-AD and 66\% of Wt rats entered the previously cued location at least once (X(1)2 = .17, p = .67). Furthermore, both groups stopped at the previously cued location and the number of stops at this location did not differ between groups (X(1)2 = 1.27, p = .25). Although the median latency to reach the cued location was lower in TgF344-AD rats (4.31 s) compared to WT controls (20.7 s), this was not significantly different, (X(1)2 = 3.12, p = .07). 

We next sought to identify whether rats returned to their primary home base location on day one. The distance between primary home bases between days was computed for each rat. Median distances between primary home bases between days suggested that TgF344-AD rats tend to make home bases nearer the previous day’s location (TgF344-AD: 47.1 cm), though this was not significantly different than controls (WT: 116.2 cm) (X(1)2 = 1.92, p = .16). 

Overall, these results indicate that the removal of a proximal cue influences the behaviors of TgF344-AD and Wt rats similarly during open field exploration. 

\section*{Discussion}

This experiment identified that exploratory and home base behaviors are similar between TgF344-AD rats and F344 (WT) controls at 13 months. On an open-field, TgF344-AD rats travel similar distances and explore similar proportions of the total maze as WT controls. In addition, we found no differences in average linear or angular velocities between these groups. Segmenting paths into excursions indicated that TgF344-AD rats tend to travel in more direct paths in between stops, whereas WT rats tend to have a greater extent of meandering. Nevertheless, the frequency of excursions and median duration of these excursions is comparable between TgF344-AD and WT rats. Analysis of stopping behavior revealed that the median stop duration for TgF344-AD rats was shorter than that of WT rats, yet the frequency of total stops made were similar between groups. Additionally, TgF344-AD rats established home bases and spent a similar amount of time in their primary home base as WT rats. Interestingly, both TgF344-AD and WT rats showed split influence of a proximal visual cue in determining their primary home base location, whereby the proximity of the primary home base to cue location resembled a bimodal distribution for both groups. Overall, TgF344-AD rats show few differences in locomotor behaviors while responding to environmental features and when establishing a home base at 13 months compared to WT controls. 


These analyses expand upon prior assessments of open-field behaviors in TgF344-AD rats. Locomotion measures reported in previous open field experiments involving TgF344-AD rats have largely focused on gross metrics of movement such as distance travelled \cite{morrone_regional_2020,voorhees_occupational-like_2019,voorhees_-p7c3-s243_2018} or beam breaks \cite{cohen_transgenic_2013}, while limiting observations to 10 minutes of open field exploration. While these metrics hold value in understanding the extent of movement during exploration, they provide an incomplete profile of how TgF344-AD rats explore novel, open-environments. This study expanded the locomotion profile of TgF344-AD rats by examining kinematic attributes, including linear velocity/acceleration, angular acceleration, and features of movement segments and stops. Kinematic analyses have shown to be powerful discriminators of strain or genotype \cite{benjamini_ten_2010}. Furthermore, evaluation of kinematic profiles of excursions or incursions from a home base have been implicated in supporting dead reckoning, or the ability to locate a point of departure by continuously updating current position through the integration of self-motion cues \cite{wallace_fractionating_2008,wallace_movement_2006,wallace_quantification_2002}.


The kinematic profile of TgF344-AD rats largely resembled that of WT control rats except in regards to stop duration and circuity of movement segments. TgF344-AD rats tended to stop for a shorter duration compared to control animals. Similarly, short duration stops have been observed in Fimbria-Fornix lesioned animals \cite{whishaw_short-stops_1994}. However, it is currently unknown whether Fimbria-Fornix function is altered in TgF344-AD rats; thus, future work should explore pathology in this region or examine the functional connectivity between regions connected by this fiber pathway. The finding that TgF344-AD rats demonstrated decreased circuity in movement segments might suggest a discrepancy in their.  
Home base behaviors were found to be similar between TgF344-AD rats and WT controls.

It is possible that similar locomotor behavior may be due to anxiety-like behavior exhibited by both groups of subjects. One limitation is that these rats were tested during the dark cycle in a well-lit room. Rodents typically prefer dark, enclosed spaces (CITE) therefore it is likely that all subjects may have exhibited heightened anxiety-like behavior throughout the task. Although this is a concern that should be taken into consideration, all subjects were exposed to the same environmental conditions therefore it is unlikely that an increase in anxiety-like behavior was the driving factor behind the observed behaviors. 

Emphasize Fisher 344 model and normal aging and exploratory behavior assessment

Overall, the results of this study indicate only subtle changes to locomotion and intact home base behaviors in TgF344-AD rats. This indicates that exploratory behaviors may not contribute to observed spatial navigation deficits found in TgF344-AD rats \cite{berkowitz_progressive_2018}. 

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Subjects} 
Twelve TgF344-AD rats counterbalanced for sex and expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) and presenilin 1 (PS1$\Delta$E9) were obtained directly from the Rat Resource \& Research Center (Columbia, MO). Twelve wild type Fischer 344 (WT) rats (Harlan laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) counterbalanced for sex served as control subjects. Subjects were maintained under controlled temperature (21 $\pm$ 2 $^{\circ}$C), were housed with TgF344-AD or WT pairs, and were kept on a 12-hour light/dark cycle (lights off at 09:00 AM). Food and water was provided \textit{ad libitum} throughout the duration of the study. Furthermore, all animals were part of a longitudinal study assessing various behavioral phenotypes, some of which have been reported previously \cite{berkowitz_progressive_2018,pentkowski_anxiety-like_2018}. Thus, all animals had extensive handling and prior experience in both wet and dry maze experiments starting at 4 months of age. Animal care practices and experiments were approved by the University of New Mexico Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

\subsection*{Testing Room}
Testing took place in a large, white, well-lit room. Located in the room was a table with a computer, a table with a white noise machine, a cabinet, a trash can, a paper towel dispenser, and a sink. A video camera was mounted above the open field apparatus. Video data was collected for all experiments. Prior to each behavioral test the white noise machine was turned on to cancel out outside noise.

\subsection*{Apparatus and Proximal Cue}
The open field apparatus consisted of a large, circular table made of wood (202 cm in diameter). The table was painted white and rested on a platform that was 24 cm from the floor. A Styrofoam box 27.5 cm X 22.5 cm X 18.5cm was painted black and served as the proximal cue. The proximal cue occupied a fixed location in the room with respect to the distal room cues. The table and Styrofoam box were cleaned with a Virex solution between testing sessions of each rat to control for odor cues between rats. 

\subsection*{Behavior Testing Procedures}

\subsubsection*{Open Field Test} To assess exploratory behavior, rats underwent a single exposure to the large open field. Eight hours into the dark cycle (5:00 PM), rats were weighed in the colony room prior to behavioral testing, were carried to the testing room in a plastic box, and placed in the center of the open field. Each individual testing session lasted 30 minutes. The experimenter stayed in the room during all experimental testing and only interacted with the subjects to replace them on the open field apparatus if they fell or jumped off the apparatus. After each testing session, rats were returned to their home cage then returned to the colony room by 9:00 PM (before lights on).

\subsubsection*{Probe Test: Proximal Cue Removal} Approximately 24 hours after the open field test, rats underwent the same procedure as described above except the the proximal cue was removed from the maze.  


\subsection*{Data Analysis}
\subsubsection*{Movement Tracking}The location of each rat on the open field was tracked offline using DeepLabCut2.0 (for detailed review of methods see \cite{mathis_deeplabcut_2018}. Briefly, 480 images were obtained from eight of the 48 recorded task videos. For each image, an experimenter marked the nose, head (in between ears), back (middle of torso), and base of tail. Using the trainnetwork function, the labelled images were then used to train the network over 200,000 iterations or until results from the evaluatenetwork function to verified labelling accuracy was less than 3 cm. Once the accuracy threshold was met, the network was then used to label all recorded task videos. The output from DeepLabCut was then brought into Matlab for further analysis. Position coordinates that had likelihood values of less than $0.95$ or were outside of the maze boundary were removed from the analysis.
% To address possible discontinuities in the tracking data, the FixPos function was applied to interpolate and smooth over gaps or large deviations of position values that were greater than 22 pixel/sample and that persisted for 5 samples. 
Finally, the coordinates were transformed into centimeters from pixels and kept in this state for the duration of the analysis. 

\subsubsection*{Locomotor distance} A distance vector consisting of contiguous distances between back position coordinates was computed for the entire trial. Epochs of time when the rat was moving greater than 3 cm/s were then summed to create a total locomotor distance.  

\subsubsection*{Exploration Area.} The animals position was binned in 3 cm bins to form an occupancy map. Exploration area was defined as the proportion of spatial bins within the occupancy map that were visited by the rat at least once. 

\subsubsection*{Linear Locomotor Speed.} Linear speed was calculated by multiplying the distance vector by the frame rate to obtain instantaneous velocity. Instantaneous velocity was then smoothed with a moving median filter over 24 frames. 

% \subsubsection*{Angular Locomotor Speed.} Nose and head coordinates where used to calculate instantaneous angular head velocity. First, a head angle vector was found by applying the atan2. Heading angle was then run through the fixNLXangle function which interpolates and smooths over epochs of missing data points (e.g. low likelihood values) or instances of tracker flips (e.g. nose position flips 180 degrees when the nose was out of camera view). The corrected heading angle vector was then   

\subsubsection*{Stops.} Stops were defined as epochs of time where the animal moved less than 3 cm/s for at least one second. 

\subsubsection*{Home base behavior.} 
We first created an occupancy map from each 30 min session using 3 cm occupancy bins. Each occupancy map was smoothed, upscaled (to assist with clustering), normalized, and ran through K-means clustering to identify sub regions of greater occupancy. The resulting binary output was then parsed using Matlab's contourc function to identify each high occupancy sub-region or putative home base. 

Home bases were defined as regions of the environment in which the rats spent a disproportionate amount of time moving slowly ($<3cm/s$ average for greater than 70\% of the total occupancy). In addition, since potential secondary home bases were observed for some rats, we defined the primary home base as the location with the highest occupancy. 

\subsection*{Statistical Analysis} 
Statistical analyses were performed using custom scripts in R. In instances when scalar measures exhibited bimodal distributions, thresholds were used to convert the data into categorical variables. Fischer Exact tests were then used to evaluate differences between observed and expected proportions.
